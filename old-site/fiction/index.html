I sometimes received compliments of being good at english (writing). Although being compared to people who were barely fluent in english, it's not saying much.</p><p>Still, my self-assessment says that I'm sort of good when it comes to creative writing. Then I tried creating a novel, and then failed really hard. I obssessed too much in formulating a really original plot, one that hasn't been conceived by anyone yet. I gave up without even writing a single paragraph.</p><p>I guess I interpreted my self-directives literally. I didn't have to be too original--just original enough to keep myself from being filed charges relating to intellectual property theft.</p><p>If I ever did succeed in creating an extremely original novel, it would make use of no existing human knowledge, not even english. It would be akin to reading a new math proof where the words fuck you are written in precise greek dialect.</p><p>Now, after being exposed to programming and other formalisms, I feel more mentally equipped when it comes to writing. I'm not saying (yet) that I plan on shifting my goals again and reconsider writing as my calling.</p><p>I'm just declaring writing as one of my hobby, in addition to programming and learning a bunch of other things.</p><p>I'll write out of interest, gratification or<a href="./../blog/justwrite.html">frustration</a>, and put them here to... to backup some of my files in case my disk goes poof.</p></div></body></html>
