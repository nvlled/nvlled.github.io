    (almost) complete, I'm now ready to add some content for my new personal
    website.
    </p><p><i>...</i></p><p>    Or not. I'm not exactly in the mood to write now. Rather, I feel like just
    coding some more. Well, not much coding really, just more tweaking some
    minor stuffs so that little irrelevant details look right, where right never
    looks quite right. I feel like there's something missing, to make it look or
    feel right. Do I need to add a shadow here? Maybe it needs some cool
    features. But no, none of that matters. What am I even doing in the first
    place and what have I been doing in the past few days.
    </p><h1>Stuffs I did</h1><p>So if I recall correctly, here are the list of things I did:</p><ul><li>curate and crop screenshots</li><li>thumbnail generator</li><li>shitty website design</li><li>puppeeterjs setup for auto browser reload</li><li>feed generation, basically to make it like HN</li><li>bug fixes and other QOL coding stuffs</li><li>image captions</li></ul><p>    And I feel like I'm not quite done yet. But I will resist the urge to keep
    adding or modifying things and be done with it. To be fair, I'm quite
    satisfied with the setup right now. It doesn't look too terrible, and I can
    add any type of new content without much fuss. All that is left to do now is
    to write or create stuffs.
    </p><p><i>...</i></p><p>But is that all work worth it?</p><h1>Rationalization</h1><p>    I mean, regardless of actual value, I did enjoy doing it, so much I was so
    occupied that a whole week went by real fast. Is creating my own static site
    generator worth it? Who cares, I scratched an technical itch, and was
    relieved in the end. I like this setup, I'm positively sure it will help and
    encourage me to create more content.</p><p>    But again, is it worth it?
    </p><p>If not my own SSG, what alternative would I have have?</p><ul><li>raw HTML</li><li>cat+bash</li><li>PHP</li><li>existing SSG</li></ul><p>    I'm not masochistic to do (1), despite some people brandishing it as a badge
    of pride and honor. It only works for the simplest kind of site, where at
    most you have two types of pages: the index, and post page. But even then,
    there's already a problem of too much duplicated layout code. Anything more
    than 5 pages, it becomes a write-only website. Sure, a tool like sed can be
    used to modify common parts, at that point, why not use something like (2)
    or a build tool with a proper programming language. The most annoying part
    is the snark from raw HTML people who likes to pretend their use case is the
    only thing valid, that raw HTML is all ever needed, and anything more is
    unnecessary complexity.`</p><p>    On to the next points, (2) and (3) can go a long way, but they are not fun
    to write or use. I've written enough crappy bash and PHP code to know that I
    wouldn't want to write too much of it without being paid to do so. Sure,
    they get the job done, but there are plenty of other options.</p><p>    Is typescript fun to write? There are surely way more exciting programming
    languges that I've been wanting to use. Like haskell, F#, reason, clojure,
    rust and zig to name a few. But I went with typescript anyway because I
    don't want to spend too much time on this (which I already have) as I have
    other priorities to attend to. More importantly, typescript with jsx is
    indeed pretty fun to write in.
