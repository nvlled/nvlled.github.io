      with my life. Or should I say, yay, I've done something. I don't what it
      is, but it's something. An abomination perhaps. No, it's a goblin wreaking
      havoc with bananas. Also, if you squint a little bit, you would notice
      that the smoke-fire effect is actually a bunch of frogs.
    </p><p>      As the gif above illustrates, I've managed to create interactive houses
      that takes damage upon hit. This may seem like a piss-easy task, but to be
      honest it was mildly frustrating trying to get the even bare minimum
      working, which involves lots of trial and error, and frequent
      documentation lookups, and occasionally watching some old video tutorials.
    </p><p>      This isn't a criticism of godot ecosystem though. This is more of my
      impatience to get something up and working as soon as possible before I
      lose interest. As with any framework or game engine, learning godot takes
      some effort to learn how to use effectively. Sometimes I think, this seems
      to be too complex, maybe more than it needs to be, and then I yearn for
      the simplicity of Ebiten's API.
    </p><p>      But no, all this complexity is necessary I think. The initial investment
      to learn the godot editor and API might be large, but I'd like to believe
      the payoff in terms of productivity is worth it in the end, where it
      becomes easier from then on.
    </p><p>      Indeed, I thought it was fun after seeing the result: destroying houses by
      slinging bananas at them. If that was fun, wait until I get to sling cows
      at the villagers who are stealing the poor goblin's crops.
    </p><p>      If I were try to reflect why the impatience, it's because my job search
      isn't going well, and at this point I might just as well give up, and just
      go for the entrepreneurial route. I don't have anything to lose if I keep
      trying though, so yeah, I will stick to the plan of applying for jobs
      while learning gamedev. I still doubt myself though if learning a game
      engince would be the best economical use of my time, compared to say,
      learning how to write compilers or reading a computer science book.
    </p><p>      Still, there's nothing worse than not sticking to any commitments I've
      made, and not getting anything done at all. I've already started with
      Godot, I might as well stick to it until I've made something.
    </p><p>      That all said, as usual I will list the difficulties and challenges I had,
      no matter minor or trivial they were.
    </p><h1>Tilemap creation</h1><p>      This one was particularly difficult. I spent almost a day trying to look
      for tilesets in <a href="https://opengameart.org">opengameart</a>, and
      create a map that wasn't painful to look at. My terrible zero artistic
      sense aside, the inconsistent tileset that I had to mishmash together made
      it impossible to create a consistent, non-ugly ass map. No offense to the
      LPC art collection from opengameart, the art looks okay for the most part,
      the fault is entirely in my own ability.
    </p><p>      And with that, I just inverted my goal to making a game that was as
      hideous as possible, so hideous that it's too funny to hate it. That way,
      I could focus on my efforts on learning how to use Godot and not worry
      about the monstrosities that I spawn along my journey to become a shitty
      gamedev.
    </p><p>      ## Particles Creating particles was one of the least intuitive things I've
      encountered so far with Godot. And I don't mean just the documentation,
      but setting the image to use the particle was all over the place, I
      literally had to scroll up and down numerous times wondering how would I
      use a spritesheet for it. I had to follow a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMZ7yBwleik">video tutorial</a>, to figure it out. Also, I don't get why that video was so much in a rush
      to make a tutorial less than 2 minutes. Make it at least five minutes,
      what's this, a speedrun? But, I'm being an ungrateful prick again, so
      anyways, thanks random dude on the internet.
    </p><p>      Initially only used a frog spritesheet for testing, but it actually looks
      just fine as a fire smoke particle from a distance.
    </p><img src="/notes/images/dgen-3.gif"/><h1>Collision detection</h1><p>      The banana collides with the house just fine, but how to I "listen" for
      that event? I tried 2 approaches, one with polling for
      \`GetCollidingBodies\` inside \`_PhysicsFrame()\`, and the other by
      listening to the event \`BodyEntered\`. Both didn't didn't work until I
      actually had to enable *Contact Monitor*, something I read before but
      forgot.
