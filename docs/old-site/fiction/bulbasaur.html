I mean, it's humorous for me, I don't expect anyone else to find it humorous as well.</p><p class="note">I wrote this at whim when I decided to try <a href="https://freecodecamp.com">freecodecamp</a>. There was this part where I was supposed to make a tribute of anything. Not surprisingly, it didn't came out right. (And yes, the mispellings are part of the humor)</p><hr><p>A reader, who is taken aback by this sudden aggression towards his second least favorite digimon, may ask "But why"?</p><p>Upon the reception of the question, I made a sour face to which I consider the wrong question.</p><p>No my dear reader you are asking all but the wrong question.</p><p>You do not ask "Why is it dumb?", but "How is it dumb?"</p><p>The reader, not knowing any worse, gladly obliged and ask "How is it dumb?"</p><p>"Dumb is it how?" I said with a prolonged thick accent of an amateur digimon connosieure. </p><p>"Dumb is it how..?" I echoed my own voice as I think of a reason why this conversation even started.</p><p>Pitiful creature, I stared at the confounded eyes who blindly expects truth.</p><p>I drew a recently printed image of this dumb animal in question from my backpack.</p><p>I tried to maintain civility by not shoving into his face the sheer obviousness of the dumbness of this dumb animal this is.</p><p>Instead, I held the image with uttmost possible courteousness within his view frustrum and let the image itself project the meaning of dumbness directly towards his dysfunctional eyeballs.</p><p>.............</p><img class="bulb" src="./../../{{url &quot;/images/bulbasaur_by_elfaceitoso-deviantart-aa94.png&quot;}}"><p>Without words to evolve the suspended state of affairs, I interrupted the blank stare that was spiraling towards the void of cluelessness.</p><p>"Well?"</p><p>"Well what?"</p><p>"Well what do you think? Have you not arrived at the platform of epiphany where you were supposed to meet my delightful cohort called my-point-being?"</p><p>"What in guddarn name of pokeballs are you talking about? I see nothing dumb with this picture."</p><p>Oh credulity! Don't leave me behind! I beg of thee! It's not what you think, let me explain!</p><p>My neglected acting lessons were put into action as I performed a sololiquy in the face of disbelief. A person can only be serious in a topic as serious as this. This person does not joke. He is the joke.</p><p>I settled down after performing a local folk dance that is known for it's exaggerated hand movements.</p><p>"Well, let us see, where do I begin?" Is it the protuding ginormous onion on it's back? Or those ears that lack holes where the drums should have been? Maybe the skin patches caused by a persistent skin disease? No, no, no, that's not how it's dumb...</p><p>I convoluted, struggled for the precise sentence that will pass the unforgiving panel of the post-doctorate dissertation entitled "The sheer dumb stupidity of the least favorite digimon character: Blubasaurus".</p><p>I threw my hands away in resignation. More-refined, astute gentlemen have expressed their rigorous arguments on this matter in a more eloquent manner.</p><p>"Here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbasaur">the proof is here.</a>"</p><p>The persistent creature, not knowing when to accept defeat, blurted out even before I could step away.</p><p>"There's nothing in that document that supports your claim! Bulbasaur is not dumb!"</p><p>"Foolish child, have you not learned to read the words between the lines? It's in there, buried thousand words deep in what is disguised as quote informative content unquote".</p><p>Upon hearing my convincing words, the unsuspecting bulbisuar apologist took a second look and quadruple-checked the hidden meaning, all the while I excused myself away from the scene.</p><p>My conviction remains pure and strong, no matter how unprovable or unsupported they are. Balbusaur is a dumb animal.</p><style>
