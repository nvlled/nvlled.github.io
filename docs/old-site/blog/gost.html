I can't remember exactly what the reason is for writing my own, but most likely reason is that I fell ill and showed severe signs of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH syndrome</a>for several days.</p><p>In addition to NIH illness, I felt strongly that writing things from scratch is an instructive experience. I wouldn't know how to write a compiler just by using a compiler. Sadly, my compulsive tendency to write things from scratch quite often deviated me from pursuing my original goals.</p><p>I wanted to start my own blog, so I wrote my own blog engine. Oh wait, I could generalize by writing a static site generator.</p><p>My priority list apparently is poorly implemented and is riddled with bugs. It could've been worse though. At least I didn't start from writing my own http server or building my own universe.</p><p>So about a hundred commits later, I had roughly working static site generator. Of course(?), by then I lost interest with this whole blogging activity. For some reason, the site generator felt tedious to use. I felt I didn't generalize enough abstractions. The templating syntax annoyed me and I wished for an embedded lisp interpreter instead.</p><p>So, as usual, I lost interest, felt like I wasted my time, what have I been doing with my life, and so on. It was a period of downtime after that, I probably just played games all day long.</p><p>Many, many depressing days later, here I am digging up an old, abandoned ruins for an artifact that I disposed. The code is not perfect, but it is still written sufficiently well that I am not attacked by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">sphagetti monster</a> when I need to add some features (not immediately at least).</p><p>The reason why I decided to use it now is because I need a static site generator. And I need a static site generator because I have some content that I <a href="./justwrite.html">wrote</a>at <a href="./gost.html">whim</a>, and several other projects.</p><p>on 2023-08-16 00:00:00</p><nav id="main"><ul><li><a href="./../index.html">home</a></li><li><a href="./../mysides.html">code</a></li><li><a href="./../fiction/index.html">fiction</a></li><li><a href="./index.html">blog</a></li></ul></nav></div></body></html>
