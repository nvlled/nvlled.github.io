I don't have the time to review all of this massive brain dump</i><pre>      I woke to a strange place
      in a wooden cabin,
      busybodies moving back and forth
      like a construction area, except
      it's mostly the sounds of wood chopping
      it smelt like wood burning,
      and a faint aroma of barbecued meat
      I remember nothing of how I got here
      so I was a little disoriented
      my head hurts as I try to remember more

      I stood up and looked outside the window,
      people of color were everywhere, moving about,
      chopping trees, digging dirt, and hauling
      mass of wood. There were a couple of large white bearded
      mixed in, some doing labor, some barking orders.

      I stared out of the window, still and frozen,
      amazed at how unfamiliar this scenery is,
      and how I have no recollection of where, how
      or what.

      Where is this? There's no way this is my neighbourhood,
      nor my workplace. I live in a commercialized residence
      with hardly any trees left, and I work at a
      shady pharmaceutical company as lab assistant.
      Wait, yes, I remember something now.

      My head was pulsating with migraine so I sat down the
      bed. Let me start over.

      My name is Thomas, but everyone calls me Tom.
      Several months ago, I was a part of the 1%
      special group of human beings, that did nothing
      all day but eat, sleep and browse the internet
      the whole day. No not, even 1%, I was sure I was competetively
      in the top ten most useless human being on Earth.
      Aha, fuck my memories, of all the things to remember,
      I remember what a failure I am, the things I just
      want to forget.

      I paced around the room to get my blood circulating,
      a few steps in, I felt a bit better.

      As much as I want not want to remember that,
      it seems my memories are anchored on things
      when my emotions were at height, sad, anger,
      frustration, happiness maybe.

      Being a failure was a core part of my identity
      that if I were to lose all of my memories, I
      still know who I am.
      Or was, at least. Until my my body and health
      fell apart and I was rushed to the emergency room.
      I went into coma for days, waking up bedridden
      alone in a room that smelt like sterilizing alchohol.

      So waking up disoriented at least isn't something new for me.
      But this place looked nothing like a hospital room.
      I feel like I was in a really remote area, farther
      away from the civilization. I see nothing that runs
      on electricity.

      I stopped pacing and stared out in the window again.
      I'm not really much of a people person anyway, so
      approaching a fellow human being is one of the
      last resort actions I take. I'd probably ask
      random turkey for information before I'd ask a
      person. Gobble gobble gobble? Okay thanks.

      No, but really, those people outside looks scary.
      In times of indecisiveness, doing nothing
      seems like a perfect action. I'll just
      mumble to myself as I let the other parts of
      my brain process the next move to take.

      After I recovered my health, I was
      discharged from the hospital. I immediately
      relapsed back to my destructive habits
      not long after. Perpetual job hunting
      was soul crushing, rejections after rejections,
      nothing was happening, I was hopeless.
      It was no surprise that, to me at least,
      that I do nothing useful. Why study or
      learn a skill when no one gives a fuck anyway.

      That's when it happened. Late at night,
      as I walking to the convenience store
      to resupply my food stocks, it happened.
      Out of nowhere, a runaway truck going at
      a billion miles per hour ran me over into
      a pain lasagna, and that's it. Game over, start new game+.
      Cheat mode on, I have a bricked health bar that doesn't
      move a pixel, I make all the right decisions, all
      the ladies want to self-fertilize themselves with me.
      Right? That's what happened to me right?

      Yeah, right. I wish. For a thousand years, I
      lived in that fantasy. Everytime I went
      outside, my heart was racing with excitement
      from that delusion, half-expecting an Isekai
      truck driver will come pick me up to the new life.
      I watched millions of anime
      with that plot like that and I was addicted to it,
      against my will. It was the perfect escape fantasy
      for me, a false hope that kept me living.
      In a way, I was thankful for it. It kept me going,
      until one day in a stroke of luck, I found a job.
      The job requirements says that it required nothing
      but a decently healthy body
      and a functioning brain, but even then I felt
      I was underqualified. To my suprise though,
      they hired me without question. I became
      a lab assitant, despite having no educational
      background. The work
      mostly includes basic clerical computer work,
      and some basic programming to automate some
      science work. The pay was decent, and I mostly
      worked in a really messy laboratory in the company
      of two eccentric coworkers, both of which mostly
      are cooped up in their own world. It was
      the perfect job for me.

      And... what happens after is...
      Great, I can't remember. I remembered a lot
      though, can't go spilling all the plot
      juice at once. I gotta go around and shit,
      trigger flags and unlock new memories.
      That how it works, maybe.
      Walking sunbathed every day to work did wonders
      to my mental health. Somehow, I got over
      the whole Isekai fantasy. Which is to say,
      I don't in anyway, believe that I actually got Isekai'd
      for real. Although some plot elements are present,
      one of the basic formula of an Isekai plot is that
      the protagonist remembers their previous life.
      For me though, I feel like I just have a bad case
      of temporary amnesia from an unmoderated liquor intake.

      Without realizing it, the color of the sun shade
      has turned dull yellow. I spent a lot of time
      musing. My guess is that the time should around
      be 16:00.

      The black and brown people outside are throwing
      shovels and axes on the ground, wiping their
      sweat and figurative blood off their faces.
      They gather around the center and drank merrily
      as they sat and chatter with relief.
      Looks like the days of hard work is over for now.
      Good job, everyone. Now someone please me
      what the heck is going on.


      ⁂

      I was about to fall asleep as I sat on the stool
      by the window when I heard incoming wooden footsteps.
      I went into full alerted, defence mode, mostly because
      of general uneasiness around people. I then heard a knock,
      later a large man comes walking in.

      "Oh, you are finally awake I see, good, good", says the
      full-on beard man wearing strange clothes. The accent
      is unmistakably foreign.

      "You really don't like ships, you puke all over and passed out.
      Okay now?", asked the giant pirate. I think he looks like
      a pirate. He must have dropped the fake eyepatch while
      chopping woods.

      I just nod my head, without moving anything else.

      "Good, good. You start work tomorrow. Come now, food is ready.",
      says the giant pirate. He went back outside, leaving the door open.

      I took a moment to process everything he said. Work tomorrow, puke
      on ship, food. I couldn't really think of anything else besides
      food right now. The savory smell of grilled meat comes uninvited
      through the door. If I really did puke my insides out,
      then I'm pretty much an empty tank right now, without any fuel left.

      Despite all the unknows still unresolved, my body commanded me
      to go outside and eat. I'm starving, and my brain isn't working
      anymore, so I had no choice but to go outside.
      I stood up slowly and walked to the front door. I took a peak
      to a crowd of sweaty people gorging on meat. I took slow, deliberate
      steps out of the door. I looked around. I looked up in the sky.
      I have no idea where I was.

      The place looked like an old village, the houses where made
      mostly from wood and stones. The village was surrounded by trees
      and nothing else. An old lady called out to me as I craned my
      neck back and forth doing remote exploration with my eyes.

      I walked up to her, and she just smiled and handed me a freshly
      grilled drumstick of maybe chicken. "Eat, eat" she says.
      I gladly accepted her offer as my stomach wouldn't stop
      growling like a wild animal. I sat down the tree stump
      and started munching. I was at home and blended with everyone
      else. Maybe it was just my hunger, but a bite out of the meat
      was probably one of the most delicious thing I've tasted in
      my whole life. I finished the whole leg in a single breath.

      "Eat more" says the old lady as she handed me another, along
      with a wooden mug with some funny liquid in it. I took a sip,
      it was most definitely wine, or whatever these people call it.
      Like the unidentified grilled meat, the maybe-wine was also
      quite delicious. I gulp, I bite, I chew, I chug, I munched,
      repeat ad infinitum. I sat in the stump in the most comfortable way,
      with the atmostphere decorated by the dawning sun placed in the perfect
      angle, making the this pirated-infested place a surreal experience.

      I'm probably just dreaming. No, my dreams were behind me, and never
      looked back. No outlandish ambitions anymore, I realized that I can live
      a perfectly fulfilling life doing mundane work at a lab.
      I wish it could've lasted longer, but then...

      It was already getting dark, people are lighting up torches,
      and lamps by the front doors. Going old school, huh?
      These guys must be hard-core cosplayers. What's with the
      funny clothes? Are they filming? Maybe I signed up
      for a weird special interest group themed around
      anime realism.

      I emptied my mug with one last desperate sip, somehow
      wishing for more, but the old lady is already cleaning up.
      The giant pirate that spoke to me before emerged from
      a cabin then clapped his hands twice. He spoke in
      a foreign commanding voice, to which everyone without
      delay stood up, picked up their tools and started working
      again.

      Must be one heck of a slave driver. What are they
      working for anyway? What's the rush, there's always
      tomorrow. I swear I told myself that a thousand
      times before. It's mostly the colored guys are working
      now, the white and the women went back to their
      own homes. I was left in the corner, whiffing the
      leftover vapor of the wine. The big pirate is
      busy conversing with a bunch of other lesser big
      pirates. It was tempting to go around and explore,
      but it might cast suspicion or touble. The
      only safe action to do now was to go back

      By work, does he mean chopping woods too?
      The heck, I'm in the middle of nowhere,
      I don't remember anything, and now
      I have to work overtime until midnight
      chopping woods. I have a mildly
      weak body anyway, I wouldn't be chopping
      wood in a day, let alone in an hour.
      I lifted my hands up and looked at my hands
      to validate my excuses.

      Aren't my hands a little too big?
      And look at my arms, I'm rippped!?
      I stood up in surprise, feeling
      own my body like I had ants inside
      my shirt. I must have looked like
      an idiot because the pirate captain
      called out to me and said "Hey,
      what's wrong Yager? Get good sleep
      now and prepare for tomorrow."

      I saluted back and said "Aye, aye, sir",
      although I don't think he heard me. I
      did an about face and went inside
      my cabin with a slight embarassment.
      I don't even speak pirate, what if
      that means something insulting to them.

      I lazily dropped my back on the rather
      firm bed, and stretched. What a day.
      I sighed and closed my eyes.
      I guess I just didn't remember it,
      maybe I started going to gyms after work?
      Working out wasn't really my thing,
      I'm someone who slouches everyday
      in front of the computer with a bad posture.
      If I have seriously developed muscles anywhere,
      it would be on my thumbs and fingers, if any.
      Did I ever go to any gyms? As I try to remember,
      I fell asleep until early morning.

      ⁂

      I woke up from a dream that I was chasing
      something in the forest. It wasn't notable
      or anything, but it was quite an underwhelming
      dream compared to the situation I'm in.
      The sun has already risen, I should too.
      My guess is that it should be around 7:00
      in the morning. The familiar scent of
      burning wood and leaves is in the air.
      I looked out of the window to see that
      the guys are already at it, chopping
      woods right off the bat. They did
      get some sleep right?

      What about breakfast? I don't
      smell any tasty stuff being cooked.
      Did I oversleep? I could use some coffee
      at least. I looked around me, I looked
      at my clothes. It's all strange.
      It's like I'm in the past.

      Or the alternate world. Did I really...?

      Three knocks and the pirate captain
      comes barging in.

      "Goodmorgen, yager. You ready? Good, let's go."

      Wha? He goes off before I could even react.
      I stood up and tried to catch up with
      the pirate captain. He walks fast,
      there's no room dilly dallies here,
      chop wood, or chop yours. This
      must be the ultimate pirate rule.

      We walked across the village,
      I just followed along without
      questions asked, although I
      have hundreds of them. I watched
      the villagers go around do
      their own village work. From
      the size of it, this place must
      have at least a population of
      a hundred, that doesn't even include
      the wood choppers.

      When we finally got to the end part
      of the village, I saw a clearing
      into the woods. That must be
      where I will be chopping wood,
      80 hours a week then. But without pause,
      the pirate captain went through inside
      the clearing, right into the wilderness.
      I followed along with no time
      to make speculations of what to expect.

      But didn't hate it. I've always wanted
      to go on adventures. The mystery around
      all of this is really exciting.
      As we tore through the dirt path,
      I heard all sorts of sounds from
      the surroundings. Animals sounds
      to put it vaguely, but animals
      I have never encountered in my life.
      Athough these parts where heavily
      forested, there still enough sunlight
      that goes through to see the surroundings.

      I noticed the pirate captain now is
      holding a sword, which he uses
      to slice occasional branches out of the way,
      or more probably to fend off potential predators.

      I think we walked for about 10 minutes,
      without a single word uttered,
      until we arrived to another cabin.
      This is area is now visibly has less
      sunlight, and further up ahead
      lies even more darkness.

      The pirate captain knocked on the door three times
      and barged in. Lamps were lit on the corners,
      one guy sitting on the floor calibrating a bow of
      some sort, and the other
      guy appears to sharpening a sword.

      "The new yager is here. You tell him
      the plans. I be back in village,
      look after slaughs."

      The pirate boss then pat me on the shoulder
      then left without further word.

      Yager, slaughs, what? How do you spell that?
      More importantly, where am I and
      who are these guys? They look dangerous.
      The guy polishing the sword, stood up
      and greeted me.

      "Yo, you finally got here huh? I heard
      you drank the ocean while on sea voyage."

      He laughs, then looked back at the other guy.
      He gestures to him and said "This is Kaatje, and I'm Vanderbilt".
      Of course, more difficult words to pronounce.
      The other guy stood up, and turned around to face me.
      Except, he's not a he, she's a girl.
      And shoulder-length waves bouncily as she walked towards
      me.

      "Ka-katyuoue? Vandorbeel?"

      "You can call me Kat."

      "Everyone calls me Van"

      "Nice to meet to you Cat, Van. I'm..."

      I hesitated for a moment. These guys
      are clearly not from where I live. But
      they seem pretty fluent, unlike
      the captain pirate.
      What do they know about me? Why did the
      pirate captain called me yager.

      "I'm Tom".

      "Tom? I thought your name was..."

      "Never mind, not important. We'll stay
      on guard until dawn, then we start moving.
      The scout gave us report that several Walghvoghels
      was spotted down south, near the creek. We
      can't afford to lose track of this one.
      you can relax for the mean time and keep
      your head in top shape. Questions?"

      I thought you'd never ask.
      I have an whole encyclopedia
      of questions and I don't where to
      start asking. I scratched my head
      hopelessly while looking at their
      shoes.

      "I'm sorry, I don't really remember
      much when I got here, so... maybe
      you can tell me a little bit
      of everything?"

      Cat shook her head, and then
      went back to her bow calibration.

      "Damn, I was afraid something
      like this was going to happen.
      You got drunk so bad that you
      blews half of your brains out.
      I heard you guys were the best
      warriors, but the worst drinkers."

      He paced around in contemplation.

      "I think this can still work out.
      We're not supposed to engage in combat
      yet, just find out the enemy base."

      Enemy? I don't like where this is going.

      "So, what do you want to ask? Which part of
      the plan? Infiltration? Recon?"

      "Yes that, but first I want to know
      where I am. Where is this place?
      What are you people called? And uh,
      what year is this?"

      Van bursts out laughing, uncontrollably.
      That's the first time I told a joke
      and someone literally LMAO'd on
      the brink of insanity. I'd be laughing
      too if I wasn't I joking.

      "Yo-you're kidding. Oh my God, you're
      killing me." His laugh engine is
      starting to slow down, but let out
      a few revved suppresed giggles.

      "Eh-heh-he... I'm serious though."
      I said with a defeated smile.

      "I know, I know. Sorry, didnt mean to
      laugh that much. This is the first time
      I heard something like this. Did you
      accidentally drank the fuel, haha"

      Van went into semi-serious mode.
      He took a seat by the table with
      a fading candle on top of it.

      "Well, what are you standing like
      a uncut timber for? Take a seat, this
      is gonna be a long one."

      I pulled the chair from the window side
      and cozy up by the candle light.

      Cabin story-stelling in the middle of
      the forest. All I need now is some blanket
      and some snackies and it would be perfect.

      "What are you spacing around for? You looking
      for something? Have you eaten yet?"

      "No actually, I'm starving now that you mention it.

      "Can't have that now, can we? A warrior always
      have to be battle-ready mode."

      "I'm on it." says Cat, after which she went outside.

      Van stood up to and went to a section of the cabin
      to what appears to be a makeshift kitchen.
      He put out a kettle and started a small fire.
      He took a bag of beans out. I think he's making
      coffee? There's coffee here?

      "This place, this whole big island, it's called Mauritius."

      Maritius? Have I heard of that before?

      "Maritius was only just recently discovered, and
      we are around the south-east part of the island.
      As you probably realized, this place doesn't have too much
      people yet. It's mostly wildlife and vast unexplored
      forest areas."

      "What part of continent is this? Americas right?"

      "No way, not continent, just an island.
      And you're way off, we're eastwards of Madagascar.
      Or Africa, if haven't heard of it."

      East of Africa...!? It's official, I'm fucked.
      Even worse, I'm not isekai'd into a magical
      land like I was secretly hoping for. Forget
      catgirls going nya nya on me, the best possible
      outcome I could get is that I get out of here
      alive, intact without a single feral beast clawing me
      half-dead.

      Van handed me a steaming hot cup of coffee and
      sat back down on his seat across me. There's
      coffee at least. I took a careful sip. This
      is some good freshly brewed coffee. I savor
      the aromatic steam as I closed my eyes.

      ⁂

      I remember the last coffee I had was when I was
      at the lab, around 18:00. I should be going
      home by that time, but it was raining really hard.
      I only walked to work, I have no cars, not even an umbrella.
      I didn't mind though, the lab was my second home.
      Standing by with a mug of coffee was part of the work routine.

      One coworker already left for home, quite earlier than usual,
      probably did a rain check ahead of time. The other equally
      eccentric one was still in the lab. I don't think I
      ever saw him go out. I was playing solitaire on my workstation,
      when Bob, suddenly broke the rain-spattered silence with
      an explosive interjection.

      "WHAT!? This is impossible. That can't be, this is crazy."

      I almost dropped the mug in hand. He continued to mumble
      to himself incomprehensively while he rummages through
      a mountain of printouts scattered on his desk.
      It seems he discovered something serious, I thought.
      But whatever it is, it likely beyond my level of
      understanding. They are legit, science nerds, Bob
      and the other one. Bred with academic pedigree right from
      the very young age. I used to do well in school too,
      until highschool where it went downhill from there.
      I used to blame it on games and that I wasn't focused
      enough. But that wasn't true.
      I just hit my hard limit when it comes to
      academic performance. In short, I'm too dumb for
      classroom setting. Or life in general. I'm only good at
      certain things, and even then, I'd rank around
      below average if I'd compare myself against people
      around the world.

      As so it happens, the work I do is one of the few things
      I'm good at, which unfortunately I just discovered too late.
      I could've have nourished this skill earlier, maybe during
      my formative years. Maybe, just maybe, I'd be one of the top
      in this field. But of course, that's just making excuses.
      In reality, I just suck. And that's okay too. I suck
      and it doesn't matter. What matters in the end is that
      I have hobbies to enjoy in my free time, or that I have escapisms
      to indulge to on difficult times, or uninterrupted peaceful
      solitude during slow times.

      It was getting colder. The air conditioner is always running,
      even during rainy days. I thought it was because the equipment
      here are sensitive to heat, but really I think it's because
      Bob just likes it cold here. Coffee does taste especially better
      in the cold.

      The rain wasn't going anywhere soon. It seems to be raining harder
      than before. It could be a hurricane. I reckoned I'd be sleeping
      under the desk for the night. I always wanted to do that. Yeah,
      like those mad scientists, too committed in their research that
      they neglect their basic needs. Like the mad scientist behind
      me right now.

      Bob has again transitioned into a state of delirium, making
      occasional noises that would be indescipherable to the normal world.
      Anyone who doesn't know Bob and sees him like this, would contact the
      local authorities right away. I guess that's one reason
      I never see him in the streets. In the first few days of my work,
      I was also scared. But over time, I knew that Bob and the other one are a
      harmless bunch.

      That all said, I do think a consultation with a therapist or
      psychiatrist would help them. Probably. Bob is a stereotypical
      charicature of a mad scientist. Almost comical really, if it
      wasn't unsettling at times. Tim, though, is a perfectly
      functional human being, but equally capable. Outrovert, gets
      along well with everyone, even with the suits,
      even with people like me.

      On the surface, at least. I've been around these guys to know
      lurks deep inside. For the other one, outroversion is just
      a shell to interface with the real world. The madness seeps
      when the pressure sets in and emotional spectrums are messed up.
      I'm not referring to Tim, the outrovert. When I say the other one,
      I'm referring to the real mad scientist within.

      These labmates of mine, I know for sure they won't hesitate
      to cross ethical and moral bounderies for science. That is to say,
      Bobby and Timothy pose a general danger to humanity. But individually,
      as a coworker, as a person you meet in person, they
      are harmless.

      They are harmless. The mad scientist behind me is harmless.
      I am safe, there is nothing to worry about. The rain will
      go away soon. I'm definitely not panicking, and the lights
      definitely won't conveniently go out for some reason.

      And the light flickers.

      I looked behind me. Where's bob?

      ⁂

      I heard the cabin door open, Cat enters with skewered
      meat slices in her hand. She prepares them on the small
      round table in front of me.
      "Dig in" she says as she pulls another
      chair next to me. The three of us ate in silence for
      a while.

      It doesn't really help if I try to forcibly remember
      the chain of events that lead me here. I just remember
      without trying. It's either my memories need trigger from
      my surroundings, or just that I just need to wait
      for my memories to come back on their on own. In any case,
      I just hope I remember everything in time, because
      I don't know what I'm getting into.

      "Maritius. What are we doing here? Who was that big guy
      that brought me here? Why is everyone chopping wood?"

      "You really don't remember anything, huh? Not even
      the leader that hired you for this mission?"

      "Dirk's the name. He's the one leading the whole
      venture." says Cat who seems to be fixated on the
      melting candle.

      "Right. The big guy who hired you, the same
      guy that hired me and Kaatje."

      He stood up and stretched, then paced around.

      "The big boss didn't really tell us, but
      it's not hard to guess what they are up to.
      To claim the lands, to colonize and expand."

      Van looked out of the window.

      "Most importantly, we need to fortify the defence.
      We'll be needing lots of wood for that."

      I've been playing around with the empty mug
      as I collect my thoughts. I'm waiting for
      Van to say what we're defending against,
      but it looks like I have to explicitly
      ask. Maybe the answer is obvious?

      East of Africa. Some island I've never heard of.

      "Are we having a war with the native tribes?"

      "God no, though it'd be a lot easier if
      it was just that."

      Cat got up and poured coffee on my mug.
      She offered some to Van, but he declined.
      She then went back on the floor and
      started skinning arrow shafts.

      "We're after the Walghvoghels. But it's
      not a war, it's more of a hunt, seek and destroy.
      Kaatje and I hunt for a living, we've been hunting
      for all life. We've taken down the largest
      and smallest critters you could think of.
      But these dodaars are unlike anything."

      "Dodaars?"

      "Yeah, those damn dodaars. Dirk calls
      them that a lot."

      Agreed, dodars is easier to say.
      Wahlgoblins, wallbaghels,
      wallabiesgels, I can't even vocalize
      them in my head. I've already emptied
      my mug again, playing with it again idly.

      "So dodarrs are... what? Gorillas?
      Lions? Crocodiles?"

      Van stood away from the window and sat
      back down. He took out a piece of paper
      from a bag and placed it on the table.

      "Walghvoghels"

      No way. I've seen this before.
      It's that funny-looking big, dumb bird.
      I snortled, louder than I should have.

      "It's a DODO bird!!" I triumphantly declare
      my knowledge. I held the dodo picture
      with a big dumb smile on my face.

      "You remember now? And it's not dodo,
      it's dodaars. do-da-a-rs."

      "No, I just..."

      I cut off my own words. Dodo birds?
      These things have been extinct for
      hundred of years now. Or so I've heard.
      These dumb birds actually managed to
      survive, that's good news, especially
      for birdologists, or what you call them.
      These guys aren't illegaly hunting those
      poor fellows, are they?

      "So by hunt, you mean catch them alive
      right? For conservation and science stuffs?"

      "What? You should really stay away from any drink, seriously,
      I've been hearing nothing but crazies from you."

      "What? We're killing them?! They are just oversized
      chickens, they're harmless, and rare!"

      Van was visibly getting mad. He slammed his
      hands on the table and stood up.

      "We're done. You should lie down and
      rest. We'll have to abort for today if you
      keep acting like that. We still have a whole
      afternoon to wait. Get some sleep."

      Van stood up and opened the front door.

      "If you still insist, and have questions,
      you can talk to Kaatje here, but I have
      to warn you, she's scary when angry."

      The door closed, and he disappeared outside.

      ⁂

      Although it's not the time for such
      thoughts, I get all giddy as I now
      am alone with Cat. I took at peek
      at her as she busied herself with
      the arrow crafting. She does look
      pretty cute when I look closer.
      She look European or sort.

      She stopped and looked at me.

      "You can ask me anything" she says.

      Anything? My degenerate weeb mind
      was all over the place, but I took
      control, heeding Van's advice about
      her fury.

      "Are we really killing the dodo−
      the do-daa-rs?"

      "Hunt them, kill them, exterminate
      every single last one of them."

      Gulp. Van wasn't kidding.

      "Don't let the cute dumb look fool you.
      These beasts already took down dozens
      of Dirk's men. My friend was one of them."

      What the Walghvofuck? Are we speaking of
      the same dodo bird. That dodo bird?
      Aside from being a slow fat-ass,
      that big dumb looking bird that was
      too stupid to even try to run away from
      any predators. Isn't that why they
      went extinct easily? That dodo bird?

      Cat noticed my disoriented look, so she
      went back to her work. Wait, maybe
      dodo birds did went extinct, and this
      is an entirely different species.
      That's why they call it dodaars.
      Because it's a dodo, only with −rrs
      because it growls? What if they
      never went extinct in the first place,
      then later evolved to apex predators?

      Cat is really moe-moe when she's not
      speaking. I don't want to get to
      her bad side, so I pondered carefully
      what to ask next. Does asking more
      question help though? Now I have more
      questions than when I first woke up
      to this puzzle forest.

      Times like this that inaction is the
      best action. A moment of strategic
      idleness to avoid needless resource
      consumption. In other words, I will just
      cozy here and cherish the peaceful moment,
      in the lone company of Cat making
      sounds of timber being shaved precisely
      to a deadly, efficient projectile.

      I half-mumbled and hummed inaudibly to myself.

      Dodo, dodo, dudu, dodoo.
      Dududu dooo.

      I think I need a toilet break.
      A high-meat diet is really heavy
      on my stomach.

      Dodo, dodo, dudu, dodoo.

      Dododo..? That's when I remembered something.
      Back at the labs, the other one was studying
      about dodo birds.


      ⁂

      We take certain things for granted, we wouldn't
      realize it until it's gone. Comfort and convinience
      of modern civilization. Clean water, decent food,
      endless entertainment, safe shelter from post-extinct
      predatory birds. And arguably the most important,
      a functional sewage system so we busy people of modern
      age never have to worry about the process of taking
      a dump.

      I looked around to address my current issue.
      It is no surprise since my awakening that I
      have not once seen anything that will accomodate
      my bowely discomforts. I'm in a remote island,
      eastwards of Africa, thousands of miles away from
      recent technological advances.

      "I'm going back to the village to.."

      What's polite term to excuse myself?

      "If you're going to take a dump,
      there are thick bushes outside. It's
      easy to get lost around here, and not
      safe to go alone."

      Right away, my lady.

      I nodded to her, and without delay I head
      outside. Van was nowhere to be seen. I
      scan the surroundings for the area of
      deployment. Any bush will do really,
      indiscriminately I picked the one closest.

      I carried out the process as quickly and
      as efficient as possible, utilize all the
      available resources at hand to get the job
      done. Leaves and dirt should do.

      In less than a minute I'm back in front
      of the cabin door. I stretched fully and
      get a feel of the surroundings. It's noticably
      colder here compared back at the village.
      There really wasn't much to see except for
      the possibly decades old trees and plants
      everywhere. The place was densely populated
      with towering trees, it's hard to see beyond
      several meters ahead.

      If what Van and Cat says is true, then it's
      not safe to stand out here in the open unarmed.
      It's still hard to believe that such a dumb
      looking bird could pose such a threat, but
      I'm not taking any chances. Besides, I don't
      hate being alone with Cat.

      I went back inside.
      Cat is now busy testing the bowstrings.
      Questions can come later, I need to sort
      my mind first.

      I see a bookshelf by
      the window that I didn't notice before. I
      took a random one back to my seat.
      I crack the book open in the middle,
      only to see gibberish words. What
      language is this? Oh well, at least
      it has pretty drawings in it.

      I browsed the book without much thought.
      I flipped the pages, one after the other.
      Then finally I got to a page with a large
      sketch of the dumb bird.

      "Walghvoghel" says at the bottom of the page.

      The sketch of the dodo bird is really done
      well, precise and detailed up to the fine
      grains of the feather.
      It's really just a dodo bird no matter how
      I look at it. No evolutionary changes, no
      sharp teeth, no razor claws. The wings
      are still useless as ever.

      Once again, I started to doubt this whole
      operation. Could they be mistaking it for
      something else? Did they actually see
      the dodos attack?

      I flipped the pages more. It's was a lot
      of words, none of which I can understand,
      even a little. What's strange is the texture
      of the pages. The paper used seems really
      different from the usual ones found in books.

      I used to pick up random books back at the lab
      too. Like this one, I could not understand anything
      even if it's written in English. But unlike the books
      back at the lab, this book has a very unmodern
      feeling to it. Dated? Archaic? Medieval even?

      Or how did Tim describe the period of dodo birds.
      Colonial? Why was he studying dodos again?
      I stared blankly at the wall of gibberish.

      ⁂

      "Bob? Bobby man? You there?"

      I whistled, still no response. I slowly
      got up. I walked to his messy desk,
      I hear something. I looked under
      the desk to find a snoring mad scientist.
      Bob's just sleeping. He actually
      does everytime. I don't know why
      I'm too anxious. This heavy rain at night
      is making me paranoid.

      I went back to my workstation.
      I should've just left earlier, at most I'd get
      my clothes wet. But now, it's really late,
      everyone else has gone home, the light rain
      turned into a raging thunderstorm. Even
      with a borrowed car, it's still would
      be risky to go out now.

      I resigned the thought of going home
      for the night, I went out of the lab,
      into the empty dimly lit hall, looking
      for a functioning vending machine. They
      have these contraptions on every other corner,
      but quite a lot of them are broken.
      People frequently pounding on them
      didn't really help.

      I found a working one past the bathroom,
      where I did my messy business quickly.
      I got a cup of coffee and a can of
      pork and beans. It's more than enough
      for a dinner. I took a quick peek at
      the empty lounge to see if anyone is
      there, I would say there's noone in
      there, but who knows, maybe a ghastly
      apparition is a floating around. I'm
      not going to stick around longer to
      find out, so I took my meal back
      to the lab.

      I took a quick peek at Bob to see
      if he's fine slumbering on the cold
      floor. His thick lab coat doubles as
      a blanket. Plus, there's a heater installed
      under each desk in the lab. There's a rule
      in this lab that anyone is free to do
      anything, provided it doesn't impinge
      on other's agency. With that rule,
      Tim and Bob does a lot unconvetional
      things in the lab. Not immoral or bad,
      just plain weird.

      I've spent enough time in the lab
      to adapt to my surroundings and expand
      the premises of what I consider the norm.
      Even, I took advantage of this rule
      to explore my creative tendencies.

      Of course, this is just a long-winded
      way of explaining what I'm planning
      to do for the rest of the night.
      I took my laptop under my desk, along
      with my hot and cold meal. I also put
      on one of the lab coats. To simply put,
      I'm camping under my desk. There's enough
      space to stretch out fully and sleep comfortably.
      I can use some of the books with some cloth
      over them as a pillow.

      I might even go far as to say that this is more
      homely than my bed back at my apartment.
      It gives me a sense of safety under the fortified
      desk, and the temperature was evenly balanced
      between cold and warm. The loud thunders and
      the wailing winds didn't bother me one bit.
      I spent the remaining midnight slouched
      in front of my laptop, unproductively
      watching random videos as I chomp on
      the porked beans.

      I fell asleep with some nature documentary
      playing low-volume in the background.

      ⁂

      I woke up to people murmuring in the background.
      I slept in a bad position so my neck sored a bit.
      I emerged from the desk tent, greeted by Tim
      as I stretched out my arms.

      "Morning Tommy. Finally devoting your
      life to science, I see." commenting on
      the fact that I slept under the desk
      while wearing a lab coat.

      "Hrmmm mornin" I mumbled back to Tim.

      I head to bathroom firstly to clean up.
      When I got back, Tim and Bob were having
      some sort of heated argument. They do
      that sometimes though, and they don't
      resort to yelling or fighting even if
      they end up in the polar sides of the argument.

      I wouldn't able to understand any of it
      though even as I listen closely. Them
      talking though makes a nice addition
      to the ambient noises in the lab.
      It was already past 9:00 so I started work
      still half-awake. It's for the most part,
      just clerical work that can be done
      without putting much mental effort.
      I save my creativity for my hobbies
      on my free time, and for the occasional
      programming work that needs to be done.

      The whole day at the lab went by
      quick and unremarkable.
      If I were to log something
      at a journal, I'd write something like:
      typey keys, eat munchies, sippy kohii,
      and more typey keys.

      Although camping was fun under the desk,
      I need to do something back at home, so
      I prepared to clock out early today.
      But on my way out, Tim interjected my
      departure.

      "Wait Tom. How would you like be
      the pioneer of the future science."

      Pioneer?
      It sounded less of a question or recommendation,
      and more of announcement of what's about to happen.

      Bob stood beside him, with an unpaintable
      expression on his face. Like a smirk,
      but more twisted. Looks like they managed
      to settle their differences, and compromised
      for a solution, and decided to work together.
      Good for them. Maybe not so good for me.

      "I'll think about it" then I left.

      It seems to be a trap position where
      it sounds good, but was actually going to cause
      me a lot of trouble, even considering the best case scenario.
      But at the same time, I was morbidly curious.
      I never said it at loud, but I always wanted
      more hands-on participation in whatever the heck
      they were doing. It looked fun and important
      at the same time, more importantly fun.

      It might also be the once in a lifetime
      chance to finally redeem myself as a proud member of
      human beings that contribute
      back to society. I would pull myself from
      the dark recesses of humanity where I once
      spent most days obsessing over questionable
      japanese eroge from diverse media sources,
      and place myself amongst grown up men
      and see them as equals. If I play my cards rights,
      then I could climb the ranks higher, to a point where
      people wouldn't hesitate to stab anyone in the
      back and eliminate anyone who gets in the
      way, if it means maintaining or improving their
      status. Why would I dare try to comingle with
      such deplorable ass kissers? Why of course
      to play fire with the hellspawns,
      they'd try their very best to bring me down,
      and down I will, for I will not resist
      and lose everything. I will be back to
      where I belong, on the lowest cesspit
      of society, back to routinely jerking my immaculate dongs
      to any japan made artworks. Only this time,
      I will have no regrets, and have every reason
      to blame it on the fuckers that pushed me
      off the social ladders. I will be basking
      in my own degeneracy, just the way I like it.

      Pardon, this rambling's of a madman is uncalled for.
      These freaks in labsuits must be getting into my head.
      In actuality, I've never gotten far enough in life
      to have first-hand encounter with backstabbing social
      predators. They, of course, exist on all class levels, but
      the worse ones are at further up the social hierarchy.
      They could though prey upon the degenerates if any of
      these losers show potential to overthrow their status.
      But I don't have potential, and I've always been at the very bottom
      of the food chain. Still, the peril lies ahead, and I should venture
      carefully if ever I consider trekking into this human wildlife.

      Which isn't to say every successful person is a backstabbing
      social predator. Those with remarkable skills and talent
      can get very far in life without building an empire of sycophants.
      Tim and Bob are good examples. A bit off the knockers, but are
      pretty doing well in life. Here I was hoping some of their
      talent and wisdom would somehow rub off on me, yet so far
      I'm only inheriting their madness.

      Walking does get my mind wandering.
      I stopped and sat at the roadside bench located
      half-way between my home and the lab.
      It's not like I'm all winded out from walking,
      I thought this was a nice place to hang out and chill.
      I took some snacks as I ponder what Tim meant by the offer.

      There's I good chance I'll just be used as a lab rat.
      Still, it's not a bad deal if it somehow ends up making
      leaps in technological advances. Okay, maybe not leaps,
      just a small step, like a low-cost high nutrition food
      sources, or maybe cure for depression without ill side effects.
      Even then, a small step like that is way off my capabilities,
      even if I work all my life towards that goal.
      You could say I was fated to be a labrat.
      My destiny, my one chance to contribute to humanity,
      after which then I will spend my remaining life
      as useless a sack of meat, guiltfree and satisfied.

      Are these my own words? Or am I just regurgitating what
      those lunatics have been saying to me?
      Whatever. I got up and continued walking. Fine, I'll
      be the rat. Turn me into a zombie frankenstein, bring it on.

      ⁂

      I dozed off I bit, I woke with my face flat on the table surface.
      Cat was no longer sitting on the floor, and I was alone in the cabin.
      I thought they left me alone, but then I saw Cat standing by the window
      outside. She seems to be talking to someone, could be Van.

      I rubbed my eyes closed, not sure how long I slept but I
      feel like a timber just fell on my head. I still haven't remembered
      everything, but now I could roughly guess what happened to me.
      Maybe.

      The two madmen, Tim and Bob, shipped me over to the east of Africa,
      probably against my will, to hunt for these oversized chickens
      because it was found out that these birds are immortal beings
      and they are the secrets of life and universe.
      Okay, I made that one up.
      Being shipped in the middle of nowhere makes no sense. But it's something
      those two would definitely plan and do.
      As for my missing memories, maybe I did overdrink while travelling
      on the ship, or knocked my head while a turbulent wave passed over.

      In any case, I think it's clear what I need to do.
      I'm here in the name of science. I am the warrior of truth,
      to fight against the beast that represents the limitations of current
      human understanding. I will, with the saber of science,
      bring forth to a future where all beings on earth, bipeds or quadpeds,
      will comfortably live a life of weebness with maximum
      efficiency.

      This is it, this my calling. I have my goals, no more hesitations,
      charge on ahead to victory. Step forward. Do what must be done.

      ...

      To hunt big dumb oversized chickens...? In the remote wilderness?
      Where's all the cool science gadgets to make my life easier!?
      At least give me a solar-powered ipad to play games!?!?
      I couldn't flip the the table in front of me upside down
      because it was impossibly heavy. The more I remember
      about those two madfreaks, Bob and the other one, the more
      I hate them.

      I returned the useless book back on the shelf. I paced around
      the room to calm myself down. I don't think I need to remember
      more to help my situation. What's done is done, I'm already here.
      There's is no escaping from it. Just go along with the mission,
      whatever it is.

      Primary mission: do not die
      Secondary mission: follow orders that doesn't kill me

      Easier said than done. When things get's really bad, I
      can always just dig a hole covered with bushes, and cower
      inside it until nature does natural selection. Cat and Van seems to
      be good people, and sorry for the disappointment, but
      I'm the wrong person for the job. Hey, that's an
      excuse I can make. "You got the wrong guy, I remember
      now, the guy you are looking for fell on the sea."
      Or something.

      A nostalgic pang came to me. It's something I've done a lot
      before. Make excuses. Give up before even trying. Fail
      and disappoint everyone. Finally, wallow up misery. And
      the cycle continues.

      It is said people can only make a new turn
      when the path diverges before them. They can't change
      their mind halfway through to go back and pick another one.
      At the same time, new paths don't just appear conveniently
      out of nowhere. People have just to keep going until
      a new decisive turning point appears.

      With this admittedly cliché metaphor in place, before
      me is a path that branches into two: one that goes
      straight on ahead, where I be me and do what I've always
      do. That path is clear and predictable, with no seemingly
      apparent dangers that waits ahead. Also, it's dull
      and boring compared to the second one. The second one
      branches out far into the unknown. That path that
      leads straight into the den of deranged chickens
      that preys on hairless monkeys. In the very core
      of this den lies a treasure box that houses
      the future of science.

      Normally, I'd call myself crazy−no crazier if I'd
      chose the second one. But there's nothing normal
      about this situation. I've too deviated too far
      from the normal route. The first path could just be an illusion,
      it either leads to a dead-end, and just connects
      to the second path anways.

      With my sound reasoning established,
      if I can call it that, I head towards the door,
      set out, not as the cowardly lab assistant,
      but as the reborned hunter, the Yager.

      ⁂

      "Yo, Cat. I'm ready."

      Tree leaves shook from the above, then
      a person jumped about two meters from
      the above down right in front of me. It
      was Van.

      "Great! Just in time. It's still a bit early,
      but we can move now while we discuss the plan."

      Van went inside, rummaged through a pile of
      what sounded like steel, and got back
      with three sheated swords. He handed me one,
      and held onto the other two. Cat stood firmly and focused,
      as fully-equipped archer. Her eyes were vigilantly
      monitoring surrounding areas. Van carries a bag
      over his shoulder.

      // What kind of sword? It doesn't matter I guess.

      "Okay, let's go."

      Obviously, I have no idea where we are going,
      so I will just trail behind them, with Van in
      the lead. And of course, we where going straight
      to the path that leads further deep in the forest.
      In addition to the pre-night time, it got dark really fast
      because of thicker foliage blocking any outside light.
      I was going to ask if they were going to put out
      the torches soon because I'm close to groping
      my way around.

      But no, these guys are the pro, they know
      what they are doing. If it's grope in the dark,
      then it will be grope in the dark.

      Or not. I don't have night-vision eyes like these
      two. And my God, they move fast, in this darkness
      no less. I'm going to get left behind at this rate.

      I'm not taking advantage of the situation or anything,
      but I reached out and held Cat's hand while I could
      still see, and pulled her to stop.

      "Wait" I whispered as I felt the warmth of her hands.

      I took a breather as I crouched in the darkness. Van
      noticed, and we all three regroup beside a towering
      tree, in the middle of darkness. It was eerily too
      quiet. There were sounds of insects occasionally, not
      as frequent as I would expect in this jungle.

      "What's up?" asks Vans in a low voice.

      "It's too dark, what else." I protested, also in a low voice.

      "Of course it's dark, what do you expect? Sun bathing
      in the beach?"

      Funny man. I hereby bequeath the title, "Van the sarcastic".

      "No, I mean, I can't see anything."

      "Why? Did you injure your eyes?"

      Huh? I couldn't quite see his face, but I think he's
      actually serious. Van might not be sharpest tool to
      have around. That is to say, he's not very bright, is he?
      Or miscommunication?

      "Tom means his eyes aren't well-adapted to darkness,
      unlike us." explained Cat, in a soft-whisper.

      "Why didn't you say sooner? You could have gotten lost.
      But we can't light any torches right here, we'd be
      sitting ducks if we do that."

      Van started to move on ahead.

      "You can stay close to Kaatje, but move fast,
      it's dangerous to stop and move slowly here."

      "Affirmative" I said as I clutched Cat's hand tighter.

      And so we started moving again, quite faster this time.

      Contrary to the facts at hand, I think this is quite
      a romantic scene. Sure, the scenery could use some
      atmospheric lighting, and we might be pacing a little
      too fast to slowly appreciate the bonding more, and
      that in a short notice we could get ravaged by
      random feral beasts. But those are trivial details
      compared to the fact that we share warmth with our
      quivering hands.

      I distract myself with these thoughts because I,
      who wimply held the sheated sword, am very scared
      right now. Quite scared, scared out of my wits.
      That is, until I held her hand. I'd even convince
      right now that this is love I'm feeling right now,
      just to drive and push all the negative thoughts
      away. If it's not enough, I could let my libido
      take over, just so I don't get overtaken by
      paralyzing fear. But there's no need for that,
      because in midst of this darkness, it's enough
      to know that she's there for me.

      We kept on moving. We covered quite a distance,
      it's like there no end to it. I gave up relying
      on my eyes and just closed them. Instead I
      fully relied on my hearing, plus my sense
      of balance with the assitance of Cat's hand.
      And surpisingly, I could "see" a lot of my
      surroundings with my eyes closed. Despite
      moving fast across these uneven path,
      I have yet stumbled and tripped over.
      My sense of hearing heightened with nothing
      else to rely on.

      Then I heard it. In the distance ahead,
      I could hear a steady stream of water flowing.
      It gets steadily louder as we move closer.

      "We're almost there" says Van in a normal voice.

      I started to calm down and relaxed my tensed
      muscles. I opened my eyes again, it was less
      darker than before, looking above, I could
      somehow see the moonlight shining through.
      I think we may be nearing the end of the
      forest.

      I could see and find my way again.
      I don't think Cat realized this yet
      since she still clutched my hand tightly,
      even if I tried to let go. Not wanting
      to break the pace, I held onto her a little
      a more.

      Finally, we came out of the forest clearing.
      A river flows gracefully under the moonlight,
      and another endless forest continues on ahead on
      the other side of the river. To our left,
      there's was a waterfall that disturbs
      the peaceful silence within the vicinity.

      "Come on" says Van as headed towards the waterfall.

      I felt the soreness and fatigue of my leg
      muscles as soon as we halted. I wanted
      to take a break a bit, but Cat dragged me on
      as she still clutched my now sweating palms.
      Romantic feels is gone, my hand is now quite numb
      to feel anything. I think she held on to it
      a little too strong for too long.

      With the noise coming from the unending falling
      streams of water, it was hard to get a sense
      of the surroundings. Even our own footsteps are
      now inaudible.

      "In here" instructed Van, as he walked past
      the flowing water, behind there was a spacious
      cave inside, enough to accomodate a dozen people.

      We followed along inside. Cat broke the bonding,
      releasing my quivering hands. My legs
      collapsed on the floor as I sat down.

      "Phew. That was close. Nothing attacked us this time.
      We lost one of our own while exploring before."
      exclaimed Van, throwing the equipment on the corner of the cave.

      So my fears weren't unfounded. I instinctively felt
      that my life was in mortal danger while in
      that unending void of darkness.

      "Of course, our mistake was that we were too loud
      and Barend was holding a torch. It was unfortunate,
      but we learned the hard lesson."

      Cat started preparing campfire as Van walked around inspecting
      every corner of the cave. I just sat there,
      watching both of them do their thing. My hand were
      still tingly, I moved my fingers as if I was typing
      in the air. There were already residual coals here
      even before arrived, which means they have already
      camped here before.

      Cat gathered the leftover firewood from the previous
      campnight. She then swiftly rubbed two pairs of sticks
      together until enough heat was generated to start
      fire. Smoke started billowing. I was afraid we'd suffocate
      here, but there was enough draft to cause the smoke to
      redirect outwards the cave.

      The campfire was just I needed, I was starting to
      feel the chill from our wet clothes. Both Cat
      and Van started taking off their shirt, almost
      in unison. Cat then took off her pants too, leaving
      her with a bra and very short skirt-like dress. Did they
      forget that I'm here too?

      "What are you spacing out again for? Take off your
      shirt, you'll get cold." barked out Van.

      I took off my shirt then too, feeling a bit ashamed
      in front of them. But these two appears to have grown
      in the wilderness, nakedness is nothing but a part
      of nature. I'm not used to any of this, is what
      I'm saying. We sat around the campfire, forming
      a triangle-like arrangement.

      "Hold on, I think I can catch some fishes from here"

      Van then stood up, took out what appears to be
      a fishing net from the bag, sat near the
      falling water, then cast the net out on the water.
      Can you even catch fish that way?
      Van now sat without any motion, like he was
      meditating, except with fish net in his hands.
      Well, he's the pro-hunter, who am I to question
      to their ways of hunting.

      I returned my gaze back to the campfire.
      Although it's sufficiently warm, it's still
      uncomfortable wearing soaked pants.
      I'd take it off too, but it's kind of embarassing.
      More than that, I have a hardened shaft
      down here. It's not my fault, I have a gorgeous,
      half-naked woman in front me. She makes no
      effort to censor her privates, or even shield herself
      from my prying gaze. It's not like I can see everything,
      but damn I can just see enough that it's worse.
      It's maddening, I won't be able to rest calmly
      for the rest of the night if I leave it like this.

      There's are more several unused firewood
      beside Cat. She took one of blocks and started
      carving. She shifted her legs into a more
      daring, provocative position.

      *redacted*

      In one smooth movement, I stood up and jump-ran
      through the water, landing on the flowing river.

      "Hey!" cried out Van.

      The water was cold, but it felt soothing,
      cleansing, like my impure thoughts was being
      purified and washed away. The moonlight
      baptized me with a renewed life.
      I got up feeling slightly less guilty,
      and swam back inside the cave.
      This is probably why I stick to hentai,
      to detach the feelings of guilt from
      the act of objectifying women's body
      as mere erotic materials. That, or I'm just
      a weeb. Or so I thought.

      I smelt something nice as I entered the cave.
      I see skewered fishes over the campire.

      "You're really a crazy one, are you" Van joked.

      "To think you'd suddenly go out for a swim"
      out of nowhere. Good thing we don't have
      drinks here or we'd all be in trouble.
      If that happens, even the dodaars will be in danger."

      I sat back to previous seat and rewarmed
      myself again. Now sure what kind of face
      I'm making, I laughing internally, sort of.
      What's more funny is that he actually caught
      some fishes, a bunch of large ones too.
      As dumb as Van might seem sometimes, he's
      got real hunting skills for sure.

      "Anyways, I think we got here a little too early,
      an hour maybe. Gregor will be here shortly,
      he'll brief us on for our next move."

      Van ended his statement with making a sighing
      sound as he stretched out his arms.

      "We're not going to sleep?" I asked.

      "I told you before, get some rest and your body
      in top shape. This is no time to be sleeping."

      Oh shit. Spanking the meat was like the worst
      action to take. I mean, what was I thinking?
      I feel really tired now, I want to sleep
      for 10 hours, like I usually do.
      Reborned yager my ass.
      I really need to get myself together.

      I stole one quick and guilty look at Cat
      one more time before banishing myself
      from this realm for good. By banish,
      I mean cowering my face behind my hands.
      With that swift glance, I noticed how
      Cat now seems more self-conscious.
      She now covers her legs and has
      put her shirt back on.

      I might be just thinking this, but I think
      she likes Van. Or more possibly, maybe
      she noticed what I was doing with my
      twerking hands while I fixed my gaze at her?
      I felt my face flush with blood, hot
      with shame and remorse. I should seriously
      banish myself from this realm. I closed
      my eyes. I should just run outside
      and let myself be bait for the dodoors,
      so we could just get all this over with and
      go back home.

      I heard a soft whisper call out to me.

      "Tom"

      I opened my eyes to see Cat handing me
      my share of meal for the night: a lightly
      burnt fish.

      "Thanks, Cat" I'm not worthy of such kindness
      but thanks.

      "What's wrong Tom? You're a bit red. Don't
      go having a fever now, I'm seriously to get
      mad."

      Shut up, I said to Van in my head.

      "I'm fine, I'm just hungry." as I said
      as I took a bite. This burnt fish is unexpectedly
      flavourful, did they add salt?

      Sharing a meal with Cat and Van is
      something I could get used to. Then again,
      it's more like I enjoy having a meal in
      scenic places. I'm still not sure
      what their relationship is though. But it's
      best not to pry on personal matters.
      I've still plenty of other questions
      to ask before I even dare to intrude
      their private matters.

      This might be the best and last chance
      to ask questions now, before the other
      guy joins the party.

      On second thought, asking potentially
      dumb question might piss Van here again.
      I don't want to spoil the perfectly good
      meal. Plus, he might get mad enough
      that he might actually convince Cat
      to just abandon me here in the forest.
      I've just known this guys only for a while,
      I don't know what they are thinking,
      or what they would do.
      Appearances can be deceiving.

      "So Tom, got any questions?"

      Going for the offensive huh?
      I've got questions, but I'd rather
      ask Cat.

      "No, not really" I chomped a mouthful.

      "Okay, if you say so. I don't know every
      bit of details anyway, Gregor will explain
      everything."

      I'm stuffed. I badly want to sleep right now.

      "Hey, can I take a nap, just for a bit?"

      "Hmm, well okay, sure. We still got about an
      hour to wait at most. You can rest too, Cat.
      I'll be on watch."

      I lay flat on my back. The cave floor has
      slightly smooth rocky surface. It's only slightly cold,
      but should still sleep on my side. I fell
      asleep as soon as I closed my eyes.

      ⁂

      I woke up abruptly, thinking I overslept. But
      I sat up to see Cat still blissfully sleep
      by the warm fire. I don't think I sleep
      that long, I didn't have any dreams.

      I yawned. Van was nowhere to be seen.
      He might be outside, waiting for the other
      guy. I stared blankly at the campfire.
      It doesn't look like I have any new memories.
      I can't recall what happened after I
      was on my way home. I'll remember
      in due time, I'm fine being clueless
      too, it's more exciting having all this
      mystery around me.

      I got up and washed my face with the
      falling water. It was cold enough
      to wake me up. I picked up my shirt,
      and to my surprise and it was already dry.
      I put it on and sat back by the fire.
      Wait, I'd get wet again anyway once
      I leave the cave. Where is Van?
      Should I wake up Cat? No,
      I'd rather not get close to her.
      Don't look at her too.

      Should I just go back to sleep?
      With the noise coming from the waterfall,
      it's hard to know what's going on outside.
      I got up again and tried to peek
      sideways from the waterfall. I can actually
      avoid getting all wet if I go out on the side.

      Not sure what I should do. Go out and find
      Van? Or just stay with Cat and wait?
      I should just wake Cat and ask her.
      I walked away from the waterfall
      and kneeled in front of her. As I
      about to tap her cheeks, Van appeared
      out of nowhere and said

      "Oh, you're awake. Good, I found Gregor.
      He found a good scouting spot for our
      next operations."

      I looked back at Cat, who was now
      sitting up, wide awake, and staring
      right at me. Without words. You
      got it wrong, I wasn't doing anything
      weird.

      She got up first.

      "Come on, Tom" she took my hand
      and dragged me like the blind wimp
      I was before.

      As we got out of the waterfall cave,
      I followed the river with my gaze
      how far it flows ahead. The
      quarter moon shone brightly upon
      the forested place, but I still couldn't
      really see far ahead.

      "This way" Van leading the way.

      Cat held my again, and pulled
      me gently forwards. I can see just
      fine, Cat, it's not that dark
      anymore. I want it to say it out loud, I
      really do. At the same time, I
      love walking close to her, I love
      how I secretly cherish these fleeting
      moments with our hands clasped tightly
      together. How I wished these rivers
      flowed eternally ahead, that we
      too would for eternities walk together
      by the moonlit riverside,
      under the beaming celestial heavens,
      our hearts beat unending as we step
      to take on the lurking unknowns.

      Alas, it was an eternity that faded
      too soon.

      Van stopped walking, and pointed upwards
      to a tree taller than the rest. An artificial
      ladder was made on its thick trunk.

      "Up here" Van lead upwards the tree.

      Cat released my hand.

      "Up here, Tom" she went on ahead.

      I looked up and see them take
      the ladders.
      I waited for a while.
      I watched the lonely river still flowing.
      I looked up again, and see them
      reached the top.

      I started to climb too, as I
      muttered to myself,
      Cat, you forgot to put your pants
      back on.

      ⁂

      In itself, an underwear is nothing
      but a piece of cloth, the same kind
      used to wipe stains, or the kind
      that protects from environmental
      sub-hazards. In itself, it has
      no significance, like a stone
      that lay purposeless on the side.
      It is in the sophisticated minds that
      give meaning to these empty fabrics.

      To see what lies beyond
      is an undeniable signs of intelligence.
      To appreciate the imperfect state of
      our universe is what separates us
      from the beasts that tear without
      thought.

      From the mortal grounds where I stand,
      I marvel undeservingly at the holy
      grail that ascends the heaven.

      Yes, yes, I saw a pantsu in full
      rear-view, I get
      another stiff shaft, and now I'm
      mumbling to myself for reasons
      or another. I'm going to literally
      beat this useless dangling
      piece of meatstick if it keeps
      inconveniencing me at every other
      waypoint, just to keep to it
      protuding without my command.

      Years and years of relieving
      myself with indecent online materials
      when I am faced with anxiety
      or difficulty, now I lose
      control of the impulse to
      effuse the latent force.
      A once a master of his own body
      is now a slave to his cravings.

      The shaft has been reduced to
      insignifance as I chant
      self-loathing unto my being.
      It worked but not always.
      Just in time, I finally catched
      up to Van and Cat as I reached
      the tree top.

      I see Cat and Van was staring
      far out in the distance down
      below, along the riverside.
      I took a breather, then a
      fully bearded man with
      an imposing stance greeted me.

      "Greetings, you must be Tom"

      He was a head taller than me,
      he looked down at me as if
      to establish the pecking order.

      "H-hello"

      Unlike Van, who's a bit of a happy-going fellow,
      This guy's asserts dominance just
      by mere existence. There was
      an implied agreement that from
      here on I'll be following his
      orders, or there will be far-reaching
      consequences.

      "I'm Gregor. Nice to meet you, Tom"

      "At your command, Sir!" I saluted back.

      He roared and laughed. He repeatedly pat me
      on the back, still lauging.

      "You're right Vanderbilt, this guy's
      funny and interesting."

      See, I'm nothing but a joke.

      "Okay, now everyone's here, let's
      start with the business. You stay
      on watch, Cat."

      The tree top was like a natural
      treehouse, except without walls.
      There were lots of branches that
      serves as natual guard rails to
      keep us from accidentally falling.
      The floors were a bit bumpy though,
      but spacious enough for the big guy
      and the three of us.

      We huddle gather around the center for
      the mission briefing.

      "As expected, dodaars were
      seen again crossing across the rivers
      yesterday. There were clear predictable
      patterns to their movements, it's
      safe to assume at this point that
      they will be doing the same again
      once the morning shines."

      "Here's how they go: early in the morning
      the dodaars travel in packs, one
      after another, moving towards a single direction.
      In the dawn of morning, they'll be heading
      in the blind forest, where you guys just
      came from."

      "They won't be seen or heard again until
      the sunset, before the day turns night. Again,
      they'll be moving in the same pattern and formation."

      "Question's so far?"

      I tried to absorb all this in my head.
      It's was hard to imagine these giant chickens
      marching across the rivers with order.

      "How may dodaars are we talking about?"

      "Lots. Lots and lots of them. I'd
      estimate around a thousand, no,
      twice at least that."

      That's crazy. We'll never go hungry again.
      No wonder children in Africa are starving,
      their meals went on hiking. But seriously,
      this is hard to imagine. I'm not going
      to believe any of this until I see it
      with my own eyes.

      "In the first few days they were first spotted,
      there only one or two packs moving. Around
      ten of them. But as the days go on, more
      and more travel across."

      "I can't give exact numbers, but it should
      be easy to notice that there are far fewer
      dodaars coming back to their base."

      Van found a turn to speak.
      "This is way off our estimate.
      With this much dodaars, this won't be
      just a hunt anymore, is it? We'll
      need a army now?"

      Come on, Van, we're talking about birds.
      Even if there are millions of them,
      in the end they are still birds.

      "Not quite. It still too early to
      go full-force attack against them.
      We still don't know what the dodaars
      are doing, and they haven't done any
      attacks since. We started bringing in
      more men though, in preparation for
      the worse. It's up to the boss
      to decide when we go full attack."

      "Discard the old plan.
      We can't hunt them
      anymore by normal means,
      since they started to move
      in larger groups now. We'll be walking
      towards death if we do that. So..."

      "We burn the whole forest down
      while they are all in the middle of it?"
      Van asked.

      "No, That's still counts as offensive.
      We don't want all of them dead yet, and it's
      not clear if that would even work.
      The dodaars afterall are way more
      intelligent and way more faster than
      we initially believed."

      "Which brings us to our new mission:
      You three will find and infiltrate
      their nests and extract any information,
      however related, that you can."

      "You're not coming?" Van wondered.

      "No, I'm not really fit for that.
      I'm not as agile as you guys. Plus,
      I'll be standing by to keep guard,
      and to assist the other incoming yagers,
      who will be trailing the dodaar battalion.
      Besides, the fewer the people, the less
      chance of detection."

      "Okay, makes sense" Van agreed.

      Does it? The whole plan sounds
      reasonable, but the part I
      can't still get over with is that
      we're talking about flightless
      chickens here.

      "So? When do we start? Should we
      start moving now?"

      "Not yet. We will wait for the large
      wave to march across the river first.
      You start moving as soon as the
      the dusts have settled. With that,
      you guys still have several hours
      to stand by."

      Yes please, sleep. My sleep-deprived
      brain can't keep up anymore of this.
      I doubt ten
      hours of sleep would help me
      make any sense of this, but
      still, sleep is good itself.

      Looking around, is it safe to sleep up here?
      I sat in the corner, resting my back
      against a sturdy pile of branches.

      "I saw some berries on the way here.
      I'll go them before the bats do." says Van
      as he descends the wooden ladder.

      Van's a real trooper, I don't think I've
      ever seen him sit for more than five minutes.

      "How is it going Kaatje, seen anything unusual?"
      Gregor asked he placed his arms around Cat's shoulder.
      He got so close to her to the point her privatures
      are in contact with him.
      He did so smoothly and naturally no one would
      find it strange."

      It was that point that I was sure
      that I hate this Gregor guy.

      Cat shook her head. "All clear, Greg"
      Then I saw Cat gave him a smile,
      a slight one. It kind of hard to interpret,
      but a smile is a smile.
      She never gave me one. Actually,
      I did get one, but it was just my pure imagination.

      I sat awkwardly as I watched the two
      get closer.

      "Hey, Tom. You go and help Van.
      I'm sure there are a bunch of berries.
      Tom can't hold all of them on his own.
      And oh, catch lots of fishes while your
      at it. Feel free to take your time."

      Gregor said all of this with a big
      twisted smile. I know where this is going.

      "Wait, Tom" Cat says softly as I stood
      up. I froze on the spot, Cat seems to be pleading
      me to stay. What do I do?

      "Well, what are you waiting for?" Gregor
      said in a louder voice. He was clearly
      getting annoyed. My intincts were right.
      This guy's the leader, in ways more than
      one.

      "Nothing, sir" I said as I descended the ladders.
      I stopped for a second to peek at them.
      I saw Gregor's hand then reach into the sacred
      grounds. I faintly heard Cat making suppressed noises.

      I know where this is going. I should
      have seen where this is going. The
      holy grail has long been claimed,
      and it's always the strongest one
      to be holding it. A precious treasure
      will always be guarded closely.
      She's mine, the son of bitch
      made that very clear right at
      the beginning.

      I continued descending, both
      in mind and body.

      As I reached the bottom, I
      gripped my hands tightly. It felt
      empty, the same hands
      that fleetingly felt joy and warmth.
      I felt like I'm missing something.
      The sword, I left it back at the cave.
      No wonder it felt empty.

      I trudged along the riverside,
      against the eternal flow of meaningless
      tide. Why do I feel terrible? Why
      should I? I literally just met her.
      My feelings are purely circumstancial,
      it bears no weight. It's just
      a short-term emotional outburst,
      it happens time to time due to
      prolonged state of not giving
      a damn about anything.

      Time and time again, it has shown
      that I can't trust anyone. Not Cat,
      not Van, not especially that cumstain.
      I bare and open up to them, exposing
      every bit of vulnerabilities and wounds,
      only for them the cut deeper when I
      least expected it. Of course I would
      flunk school, I have a learning
      disability. I just never learn.
      The lesson that human beings are
      a scourge of this earth, I never
      learn.

      I picked up my sword and got
      out of the cave without thought.
      I continued walking back.
      I should just cut that bastard.

      ⁂

      I walk and walked, on the
      other side of the river,
      away from where Cat and Gregcuck
      have the time of their life.
      not caring if my other half of my leg
      is submerged on the river.
      All bark, that's what I'm doing.
      I can make twisted angry
      faces, but I can never bite.
      I never fought back, and
      there's no reason to. I'm
      like just a dirt on the ground,
      people would unknowingly kick
      and step on it.

      Whatever. It matters nothing
      in the end. Right, I forgot
      what I was even here for. No,
      not for science bullshit, I'm
      just here to have fun and adventures.
      Forget what really happened,
      Forget how I got here,
      forget the life before me,
      this is my life now. The
      isekai that I have been
      dreaming of.

      Except it's Africa. And
      I have no special ability to
      speak of. All I have is this
      dumb sword that I don't even
      know how to use, despite having
      played billions of games with sword.

      Unsheated the sword, the blade
      shone the reflected moonlight.
      Cool, so this is a sword.
      It's the real thing. It's
      heavier that I thought it would
      be. Swordfights in games and anime
      makes it look like they were
      weilding feathers.

      Just for the heck of it,
      I started swinging the sword
      in the air, against the imaginary
      monsters. I imitated kendo stance,
      which I know nothing about,
      making swift clumsy strikes
      as I step forward. Then abruptly,
      I shifted stance like a samurai,
      striking the pitiful tree
      on my left. With my feet
      firmly on the ground, I
      did a horseback-riding stance,
      then attack with a sword
      thrust straight to the trunk.
      I managed to pierce
      half of the sword inside
      the the tree.

      Crap, this thing is dangerous.
      It's too sharp. I felt the
      exhaustion as I catch my breath.
      My arms sored a bit. It was
      fun though, I came to my senses
      as I pulled the sword out of
      the trunk. I sheathed the cool
      sword, then I heard a voice
      call to me.

      "Hey, over here" Van called
      out to me, not far from where
      I went full chuuni. I walk
      towards the pro-hunter.

      "You are never out of surprises,
      huh. Shadow sparring at this time?
      Anyway, get a look of these"

      He pulled out a bagful of berries
      from the bushes.

      "I hit a goldmine. It's rare
      to find this many on one spot."

      I took a handful and started chomping
      on them. Too sweet.

      "Master Gregor asked you to catch
      a thousand fishes." I said, half-jokingly
      of course. There's no way he can catch
      a thousand fishes, right?

      "I see, that's Gregor alright, always
      starving like a bear."

      Don't worry, he's having a full-course
      meal right now. Those cherries aren't
      hardly desserts.

      "Alrighty then, you can hold on to
      these berries, while I fish."

      And off the pro-hunter go. I
      I guess they don't sell ADHD medications
      on this island, Van badly needs one,
      it seems.

      Great, now I have to babysit a bagful
      of berries. What am I, a raccoon.
      In spite of my whining, I sat by
      the riverside, enjoying the berries,
      one by one, I chuck them on my mouth
      and spit out the seeds on the water.

      On the other side of the river, I
      look up at the tree tower, where
      Cat and Gregor work towards
      a brighter future. I don't
      want to imagine it, I don't
      need to. My head on it's own
      just replayed some shitty
      porn I watched before, but
      with their faces swapped in.

      It'll take all night to finish
      all the berries. I can't eat
      anymore though, I'm starting
      to get stomache ache. I washed
      my face on the flowing river,
      taking a drink while I was it.

      I thought of taking a nap again.
      I'm not sure what time is it,
      probably around 3:00 in the morning.
      It's a welcome experience though,
      I never thought there'd be a point
      in my life I'd sit by the moonlit riverside
      past midnight snacking on berries.
      It was a hard to imagine, considering
      I've been mostly cooped up inside.

      I'll just close my eyes for a bit,
      just for bit. I shouldn't sleep here,
      it's dangerous. But it was a homely
      feeling, the eternal river
      gushing on my side was a
      lullaby to my ears.

      ⁂

      I woke up, the sun starting to
      rise. Where am I? It appears
      that I feel asleep beside the river.
      I picked up my sword and the bag
      of berries, and slowly got up.
      I looked around, Van couldn't
      be seen anywhere fishing. I
      think it's safe to go back
      up the tree tower now. Surely,
      Cat and Gregor have finished
      their honeymoon already. Heck,
      I'd be impressed if they lasted
      an hour. That's already too
      long, even for a porn movie.

      As it happens, I heard I gawking
      sound. A chicken maybe? I turned
      around and looked behind me.
      The Walghvowhat, a dodadars stared right at me.
      I had a death stare with the giant
      chicken. We both stared at each other
      in the eyes, paused and soundless.

      What do I do? Attack it? Chase it off?
      It made chicken-like sounds again.
      If only Cat was here, she could take it
      out with an arrow.

      It made another sound again, only
      this time, it sounded recognizable.

      "Korrum wod mi" croaked the chicken.

      What? I-is it trying to speak?!

      "Farrrow mi. Korrum wod mii"

      It's struggling to pronounce it,
      but there's no mistaking it. It's
      trying to speak.

      "Follow me, come with me?"
      I said back.

      Dodaars, understanding what
      I've said, nodded back to me.
      No, no, no. This can't be real.
      I'm hearing things. I doubted
      my sanity. The berries, the
      berries were poisonous, and
      I'm hallucinating.

      Ominousuly the dodaars spoke again.
      "Korrum norw. Dors norw turaaym."

      Come now. There's no time.
      I had a very bad feeling about this.
      I looked back up the tree tower.
      Why should I follow that Gregscum's
      orders? Why should I get along
      with everyone? I hesitated.
      I'd still feel bad for Cat though,
      I feel like I'm misunderstanding something.
      Thinking about it more, it's
      more like Gregor was forcing
      himself on her.

      The dodaars made regular chicken
      sounds while it awaits.

      At any rate, it wouldn't change
      anything if I go AWOL. Cat
      and Van can still carry out
      the plans, and Gregor can
      still go fuck himself.
      I'm just paperweight that
      they have been dragging all
      along. I may find out more
      by going with this dumb chicken.

      Normally, I'd be more cautious
      and less risk-taking, but
      the bitterness, anger and frustration
      last night still runs fresh
      in my blood. I just want to
      do anything right now, anything
      except go back up there.
      The isekai fantasy starts here,
      the real adventure begins,
      all I have to do is follow
      this humongous turkey.

      But I could die.

      But maybe I won't.

      The dice of my previous life
      was rigged, this time it's
      all in my favor. It has to be.

      "Okay, my friend. Show me the way."

      The dodaars promptly made one last
      chicken sound before turning around
      and headed into the forest.

      ⁂

      The morning light now shines
      brightly over the tree tops,
      the rays beam through the
      leafy shades, lighting our pathways
      towards the destiny. A new journey
      awaits with me and my newfound
      friend.

      By friend, I refer to the gigantic chicken
      that leads my way. It's not a chicken,
      of course, but there's no law prohibiting
      me to make my own designations. I will
      call it chicken because it looks like a
      chicken, smells like a chicken and
      sort of sounds like a chicken. Most importantly,
      I like chickens. No, I love chickens.
      Chickens are one of the only things in world
      that man can openly and proudly declare
      his love to. I will take on a barehand fist fight
      on any semantic police who tries to correct
      me and take away my freedom.
      My friend here is a giant chicken, and
      that's final.

      That all said, this is still a one-sided
      relationship. I have yet received an answer
      if we can be friends. That's actually
      because I have not yet asked. But
      maybe I don't have to. Just like
      friendship happen between dogs and man
      without formalities, I can too
      be friends with chickens without question.

      It'd be rude to just keep calling my friend
      chicken. So from here on, I'll call him Ken,
      short for Kentucky Fried−No, Kentucky Friend Chicken.

      "Nice to meet you, Ken"

      Ken made chicken sounds as he turned his
      around to look at me without stopping.
      Is that a yes, or a what?

      No matter, carry on. We kept walking
      at normal pace. Unlike the dark blind forest
      that was on the other side river, the
      one where me, Cat and Van crossed at night,
      this forest is less dense. The trees
      were still just as tall, but there were
      more spaces between each trees. It
      was easy to see the way around, and further
      ahead if any predator approaches.

      Speaking of Cat, I wonder what are they
      doing right now. If I recall the plan correctly,
      they would wait for the chicken parade to
      cross through the river, after which
      Cat and Van would start going on the
      other side of the river, to the dodaar base.
      That means
      there's still a chance I could meet Cat,
      if things go right. If only Cat was with
      me when I woke up, then I'd be morning
      bright sunshine hand-holding with my dear
      Cat, away from that bastard. Or not.
      Of course not.

      Don't be fooled, women act nice to everyone.
      It doesn't mean anything. If she'd have
      a choice to pick between me and that gregshit,
      of course she'd pick not me. To pick someone
      like me
      is to forfeit the game called life, no one wants
      to be on the losing side. A women who
      picks me would have to accept the
      difficulties and challenges that will
      come along the way. Cat, or anyone really,
      would prefer someone stronger, with
      leadership, someone who can take anything
      and make things happen.

      I don't need anyone. Ken my pal here
      is all I need. Are we there yet? The longer
      we walk, the more I hate myself.

      Ken spoke chicken as if to agree with me.

      Actually, Ken was calling my attention
      for something. As we kept on walking,
      I started to gradually hear noises
      from the distance ahead. Louder as it
      gets, I see the chicken parade marching
      to my left ahead.

      It's true, it's actually real. Chickens
      marching in a semi-aligned formations.
      As Ken and chicken parade walk
      past each other, Ken made a warcy
      chicken sound, to which the parade
      leaders replied with a warcry too.

      I guess that means, goodluck or something.

      This is beyond amazing though. We have
      been walking for a while, but the
      chiken parade is still going. How
      many are there? Billions I bet.
      Okay, maybe not billions. I'm
      not good with head counting.
      Maybe 2000? Like Van said. Or
      was it the other guy that said that.

      At any rate, it was true all along.
      Even I wanted to believe it,
      it was hard to so. But my
      own eyes and ears confirms it,
      the chickens are marching in formations,
      towards the river.
      Like Ken, the otherkens probably
      can somehow speak too. Which means,
      they are intelligent, way more
      intelligent than how history
      has protrayed them. They are no
      slowpokes too.

      The marching noise gradually
      quieted down as the last
      batch of chickens marched past
      us. Ken made one last chicken sound.
      Yeah, bye friends.

      There's one thing that Van and
      others got wrong though. They
      are not violent or dangerous.
      Thousands walked past me, none
      of them threatened me. So this
      probably means they have mistaken
      the chickens for something else?
      Who attacked the village then?

      All this walking is making me
      hungry. Seeing a thousand chickens
      definitely has nothing to do with it.
      I looked at Ken's back. I wonder
      if I can take a ride. Ken spoke
      chicken. I can? Don't mind if I do.
      Ken spoke chicken again.

      Wait, I see something ahead. It
      appears to be a village. Could
      it be the natives?

      ⁂

      We finally entered the village,
      but Ken kept on walking, making
      chicken sounds as I try to stop
      for break. I followed along,
      looking around as I walk.
      There lots of otherkens here,
      but where's the people? I
      see otherkens running around,
      some playing a game like tag,
      others were huddled, making sounds.

      The houses are made of wood and stones,
      but look a bit different from
      the ones I would normally call
      a house. Ken made a chicken sound,
      he's already way ahead, I
      was getting left behind with
      my curiosity.

      But we walk more still. At this
      point, I'm pretty sure that
      this isn't just a village. This
      is a whole town. No, a whole
      civilization?!

      Where's the people? Don't tell
      me only the chickens live here.
      There's no way they built all this.
      Being able to speak a couple of
      words is one thing, but building
      a civilization is a whole another level.

      Then I remembered about them being
      dangerous. The chickens invading
      and colonizing seems more plausible,
      but still hard to believe nonetheless.
      Where is Ken taking me anyway?

      I catch up with Ken and asked slowly
      "Where−are−going?"

      Ken made chicken sounds, then after
      some struggling managed to say

      "Kiingr"

      King? I suspend my belief, or
      lack thereof, for I don't know
      what to expect anymore. I want
      a new game, this isn't the Isekai
      I wanted. Give me more Catgirls, no
      Gregore, give abilities besides
      whining to myself. Come on, Jesus
      of Africa, I know you can hear me.
      New game, new game. Or let me access
      the game settings. I said I love chickens,
      but not this much love. This is too much
      love. What's the point of being isekai'd
      if my life now is more worse than before.
      I could have gone on East Africa on my own,
      but with solar-powered laptop and some
      modern infastruture to live a comfy
      weeb life. I regret just staying cooped
      up in my room, being useless the
      most possible way. Give me my life back,
      I'll travel around the world, meet
      people like Cat and Van, and have
      great time together.

      I looked up ahead as Ken spoke chicken
      again. A stone castle, of course.
      What else did I expect? Can't have
      a king without a castle, can we?
      Did I really get isekai'd and got
      transported to a parallel universe?
      My brain is overloaded with information,
      I stopped paying attention to details.
      All I know is I entered the castle,
      and walked up until I got to the throneroom.

      ⁂

      I rehearse my lines as I prepare for
      the royal audience with the King.
      Disregarding what the nature of
      their loyal subjects and followers,
      a King is still a king. Allow me
      to undo my peasants ways and show
      proper etiquette for the ruler
      of this domain.

      Ken halted and bowed before the throne.

      I am humbled to be in your presence, my liege.
      I slightly bowed my head, with my one head
      held up to my chest. I don't know if that's
      proper etiquette, but I'd like to believe
      that's a universal sign of respect, big
      chickens included.

      I look up the throne. It was a big, fat
      brown chicken standing awkwardly on a
      stone chair. It had a bunch of leaves
      on its head that served as its crown.

      I wanted to slap someone. I wanted to
      keel over that table in the distance.
      I wanted to thwack Ken in the back of
      his head. I laughed so hard inside
      I think I suffered from mutiple organ
      failure.

      Stop, please you're killing me.
      I looked at my shoes, I closed my eyes,
      using my secret techique to mediate
      on the spot and calm my nerves.
      Dodaars, they truly are dangerous creatures.
      They are powerful beings that can take
      down fully grown men without doing
      anything. I understand now Van,
      I really do.

      I look up at the King again.
      Finally giving in, I snortled
      the same way Van showed me the
      dodo drawing.

      Ken made chicken sounds.

      Sorry, Ken. Let's start over.
      I stepped forward with the all
      dignity I have left, if I have
      any to begin with.
      What do I say?

      "Greetings, your majesty. My name is Thomas."
      I said without stuttering. Ironically, I
      make less mistakes when I
      don't take things seriously.

      "Greetings, Jager" the dodaar king said.

      His speech was almost flawless, almost
      human. I've seen parrots and ravens
      speak, but the dodaars before me
      spoke with wit and manners, albeit
      a little slower.
      I was then at lost for words,
      unable to articulate my reason
      or confusion. I had the impression
      that the dodaar was 3 standard deviations
      smarter than me. Moreso because I felt
      really dumb for not taking it seriously.

      "H-hello there" I stuttered

      "They call me, my name is Walghvoghel.
      My feathered kins are called griffeendt, but
      your people more commonly refer to us as dodaars."

      "Waf−walgovvouel is a name?"

      "Yes, that is my name. Only I go by
      that name. But if it's too difficult,
      you can call me anyway you want."

      After a brief thinking, I said
      "Can I call you Kenchi then?"

      Get it? Ken-chi is backwards chi-cken.
      Yeah, I hate myself.

      "You are as funny as I heard, Jager.
      Understood, you can call me Kenchi."

      Kenchi either got my joke, or
      can read my mind.

      "You may have lots of questions,
      but they can wait. There is someone
      who wants to see you."

      Oh no, more suspense, more exposition.
      I can't keep up with the lore, my head
      will burst. Are they going to make
      me meet another chicken in a throne?
      Pardon, but that won't work
      the second time. Your chance
      to assinate me has already failed.

      Kenchi and Kent spoke to each other
      in chicken language. I'm renaming
      Ken to Kent to make less things
      confusing for me. I have to think
      of another Ken− name for the next one.
      Kennedy, Kenson, Ken...ken? Tough luck
      for the otherkens, I don't know
      a lot of names starting with Ken. Oh
      wait, Kenneth, but I can't use that
      one. I already know too many people who
      has that name. It never feels right
      to see a colleague that has the same
      name as my pets. My pet got that
      name first, I'm sure.

      "Krruum" said Kent as he face me,
      trying to help me sort my priorities.
      Kent proceeded to the door far on the right.
      I followed Kent, fortifying myself
      against any unexpected punchlines
      that comes in the way.

      I enter a ghastly looking room,
      gray walls undecorated, with translucent
      curtains floating like spectral limbs from
      the opened windows. In the
      bed lay a sickly person,
      greeting me with a series of
      dry painful coughs. She's dying,
      I thought to myself.

      Oh god. What now?

      ⁂

      The woman in bed looked like
      she's around
      in the late forties, although
      her drastic condition might
      be prematurely aging her looks.
      I've seen women of my age though,
      so I'm certain she's 10 years older
      than me at least.

      An unoccupied stool sits near the
      bed, where doctors would be
      sitting if this place handed out
      medical degrees. Without presuming
      what the scope of the dodarian's
      medical knowledge is, I think this
      is stool is for me, for me alone,
      for this trying moment.

      I took a seat and just stared at
      her. Kent courteously left the room.
      The woman opened her eyes and looked
      at me.

      "Rutger, it's really you" coughed
      the sickly woman.

      "Do you know me?"

      "Of course, why wouldn't I know
      my own nephew. My body may
      have fallen, but my mind is
      still very much alive."

      "I'm sorry, I don't know you.
      I lost all of my memories.
      I don't remember anything,
      not even myself."

      It's of course a half-truth.
      I remember who I am, who goes by
      the name Thomas,
      but I don't remember who Rutger is.

      "Mercy on us oh lord. It's true,
      you lost yourself."

      She started a coughing fit. I
      reached for the glass of water
      from the bedside table and handed
      it to her.

      "Thank you, Rutger. I'm fine.
      The griffeendts gave me reports
      about someone looking like you.
      But the way they described you
      sounded like an entirely different
      person."

      "What reports?"

      "The griffeendt scouts all area,
      on every corner of this island,
      gives report back to me and Walg.
      There's this one particular report
      that made me smile. The one report
      that you were seen romantically
      hand-holding with a woman, in
      the dead of the night in the
      the moon river side. You had
      the happiest dumb look on your
      face, to quote directly from
      the report."

      Now I'm the one with the coughing
      fit. Who's' the traitor that sold
      me out? Was it you Kent? It was
      you wasn't it? I knew I couldn't
      trust you. Your on the special menu
      tonight Kent. You hear me.

      "Are you alright Rutger? Here
      have a glass of water."

      "No I'm fine."

      "Okay, if you say so. As I was
      saying, the Rutger I know was
      really shy when it comes to girls.
      He'd either freeze up or run away
      like a headless chicken."

      No wonder I'm in Rutger's body.
      We where practically formed from
      the same cowardly mould. There's
      probably a compatibility issue
      if I was just randomly spawned
      on different person.
      I bet ole Rutger here is into dodo
      furry materials.

      "That all aside, I'm really glad
      you safe, and made it back in the
      island. Did you travel here
      with the lovely woman?"

      I coughed.

      "About that, aunt−"

      "My name is Sofia. But you
      call me Tante. It means aunt
      in dutch."

      "Dutch? You're dutch?"

      "Yes, I'm dutch. And you're
      also dutch too, but only
      half. You grew up in
      America, so you can't speak
      dutch."

      I see, that explains why
      we can have English conversations.

      "Ta−tante, I have a lot questions.
      A lot of this doesn't make sense.
      I don't know why I am here, or
      why are you here. Why are there
      so many chi−dodaars here? Where
      are all the people? Most importantly,
      why can the dodaars speak like
      human beings?"

      "Oh my, not holding back on
      the crippled old lady, are we?"

      "No, sorry I−"

      "No, no. It's fine. It's important
      that you know these things. I don't
      have much time left." she coughed.

      "Let's see, where do I start"

      ⁂

      Kent tapped on the door with his
      enourmous beak, walking in
      with a basket of apples.
      As soon as he placed the basket
      on the bedside table, I lightly
      jabbed his midsection, and he
      retaliated back with a light
      peck on my shoulder. Kent
      retreated outside the room
      with a lots of chicken sounds.
      Kent took one confused peek
      at me before completely
      disappearing out of the scene.

      Tante laughed and coughed.

      "I see you have already made
      some friends here."

      Former-friend to be precise.
      I'm just joking of course.
      Well, half-joking.
      We both grab an apple and
      took a bite. The apple
      must a local variant, the
      taste was different from what
      I what used to. It wasn't bad,
      a bit on the sour side, but
      it makes up for the mild sweetness.

      "Where do I start?"

      She took a sip from the glass cup.
      I want to avoid putting too much
      strain on her, I should get
      right to the point. I could
      probably ask the rest from
      Kenchi.

      "Tante, first and foremost, I
      want to know why and how the dodaars
      can speak."

      "Ah, right to the root of it all.
      You see Rutgar, why you are
      here, and why I am here, is
      because the griffeendts can speak.
      Everything happening around here,
      the dutch, the hunters,
      all of it is happening,
      because, on one fateful day,
      Walghvoghel spoke his very first word."

      ⁂

      I closed the door behind me as I
      left Sofie's room. Kent led
      me to another empty room, where
      I will for the mean time rest.

      Not paying attention to anything
      else, I sat on the bed, then lied
      down. I recollected everything Sofie
      has told me, and tried to piece the
      remaining puzzles.

      It was ten years ago the Dutches
      first discovered Mauritius. It
      wasn't long after that they
      encountered these large wingless
      birds. To their surprise, the
      birds didn't attack or run.
      They were docile and friendly
      creatures that enjoyed the
      company of the hairless apes.
      Not surprisingly, people took
      advantage of this, and started
      hunting them, or rather, collecting
      them, for their own gains. Eating
      the wingless birds would one
      of the natural reasons for
      hunting them. Selling their
      meat was also an option. But
      since the dodaars were docile
      and didn't run away, the
      Dutches started selling
      and exporting the dodaars alive.

      Aside from being a temporary
      food source, there wasn't much
      reason to buy live dodaars
      except for adopting them as novelty pets.
      They were hard to breed, so
      domesticating the dodaars for
      farm use wasn't an option.

      The business of selling dodaars as
      pets didn't quite go well though.
      Not a lot of people wanted
      a weird chicken as a pet,
      and they were also quite expensive.
      They were funny to look at,
      and that's it. They didn't
      really didn't do much except to look stupid.
      Also, due to lack
      of sufficient literature on how
      to care for the dodaars, many died
      due to neglect or improper diet.

      In the end, due to scarce demand,
      dodaars remained an exotic commodity,
      where they can be sometimes seen
      in the market corner standing
      awkwardly, making chicken-like
      noises occassionally to passer-bys.

      In one of fated afternoon, a joyful
      unmarried woman was happily skipping
      and hopping along the market road,
      browsing and searching, nothing
      in particular, just anything that
      intrigues her. Her name was
      Sofie, a 40 year old woman,
      who spent 2 decades
      of her life studying nature.
      She didn't study nature in
      the strict classroom sense.
      Rather, Sofie just observed,
      sketched and wrote informal
      observerations on her diary.

      It was just a mere hobby for her,
      but she got to a point she
      amassed quite a compendium
      of knowledge. She had her own
      library of works back in her
      own little house. And there
      was room for more.

      She stopped hopping, in midside
      road, curious where the source
      of birdlike noise she just heard.
      She took a step in direction of the
      mysterious sound everytime she
      heard it again.

      One last gawk and she found
      herself face to face with the
      odd bird. Buy me, take me home,
      said the big chicken, maybe.
      That what's his face looked like
      at least.

      Sofie's eyes widened with glee.
      You could say it was the first
      time ever she fell in love in her
      again in years,
      she thought. She
      bought it without second thought,
      as soon as she finished pestering
      the owner for all the details
      she could get.

      That early evening she had
      a new family member. Her
      long time dog barked and jumped
      happily as she opened
      the front door of her home.
      Walghvoghel, as Sofie named her,
      stepped inside and gladly
      accepted his welcome as
      he made chickenlike sounds.

      From then on, Walg became
      part of Sofie's eccentric life.
      Everywhere she go, rain or shine,
      Walg was there with him. She
      made sure Walg had a proper
      diet, taking notes of what
      he didn't like, and what
      made him ill. Walg then
      was like a son to Sofie.
      She'd hug the big chicken
      on her sleep and kiss him
      goodnight.

      Years later, she came to be known as
      the weird lady with a big chicken
      on her hometown.

      If the story ended there, it
      only would have been just a heartwarming
      tale about unusual love between
      two unlikely subjects. But Sofie's
      story went on, to a more complicated
      development that she didn't expect.

      In the half a decade of care and love,
      Sofie didn't neglect her hobby of
      studying nature. Except she focused
      all her attention to Walg.
      She sketched all sides and angles
      of the large chicken. She wrote
      down all observations she can make.
      In that time, she wrote about a dozen
      books documentating everything
      about Walg and dodaars.

      One of the most noteworthy observation
      she made was that, contrary to their
      looks, dodaars were smart. Very smart
      in fact, way smarter than his dog.
      She noticed how Walg understood
      the nuances of their interaction.
      In their extensive bonding,
      Walg learned to behave and act
      almost like a human being, if
      not for the bodily limitations.

      Astonished at this finding, Sofie
      went further and started speaking
      to Walg, like how she would speak
      to a child, to her child. Walg
      didn't understand though, of course
      he wouldn't, he's just a bird. But
      Sofie didn't care, she just kept speaking
      to Walg because she like speaking to him.
      Sometimes he appears to understand,
      and would just quack back at her.
      But for the most part, Walg was
      just a listener, and Sofie appreciated
      the company alone. It became
      a routine for her to speak her mind
      to Walg, everything she thought of,
      and Walg would just either stare
      back or would just make chickenlike
      sounds.

      To the outside observer, Sofie
      was living a lonely life. People
      see her openly speaking to a bird,
      they thought she has gone mad
      from living a miserable
      unmarried life. But to her,
      she has never been happier.

      This went on for about a year,
      until one day, in the living room,
      Walg stood by the window while
      Sofie sketched her. He wasn't just
      motionless because Sofie was
      drawing her. Although his body
      was there, his mind and and soul
      were miles away from the limits
      of his gaze. He fixed his gaze
      out of the window, into a place
      from where his feathers fluttered
      the first time.

      Sofie then put away his drawing
      as she noticed Walg's absent mind.

      "What's wrong Walg? Want to go outside?"

      "Nothing, I just remembered something."
      This big, wingless bird responded. He
      said it like it was the most natural
      thing to do.

      Sofie was left speechless, his mouth
      wide agape. Her mind scattered about,
      making sense of what just happened.
      She picked them back up and recomposed
      her self.

      "D-did you say something, my Walg dear?"

      Walg didn't say anything. He noticed
      how startled and confused she was.
      He understood perfectly that no
      animals should have the ability to speak.
      In the days he walked beside Sofie,
      he observed closely his surroundings,
      every living and non-living things
      that moved. No one else spoke like
      these clothed, hairless creatures.

      He understood this and so he refrained
      from speaking, even long after
      learning how to understand and speak
      human. Walg didn't need to be taught,
      he picked up the language on his own,
      like how babies do, except he learns
      faster and with more precision.

      Walg was reluctant. He considered the
      consequences of revealing his sentience.
      His smaller, winged kins were mere sophitsticated
      automata with fixed functions. They have
      have consciousness, but only to a certain
      extent. Their awareness can not go beyond
      boundaries of their the biological limitations.
      Humans have consciousness, or rather, have more
      consciousness?

      Walghvoghel stared out of the window again.
      He didn't acquire consciousness, he has
      self-awareness as long as he can remember.
      His family and fellows at Mauritius weren't
      any different from him too. His ancestors
      have long acquired consciousness since
      their last significant evolutionary divergence.

      But unlike humans, his kind have primitive language.
      They were capable of highly abstract thought, but have
      no means of expressing them, of communicating them.
      Also, their means of leveraging tools were greatly
      limited to their beaks and feets. There was
      no evolutionary pressure for them to develop
      more complex modes of communications. Their
      life was complete with comfort and satisfcation
      in Mauritius.

      Years, when Walg was still younger, he was naive
      and dumb, greeting every hairless monkey he
      saw at the island. The older ones knew the dangers,
      and avoided humans at all cost. He didn't regret
      this decision to come with the humans, but
      he longs to see his birthplace again.

      On his own, he has little or no chance of going
      back. But with Sofie, he has an almost guranteed
      success. The problem then is to let Sofie
      know what he's thinking.

      Walg turned his head around and looked at
      Sofie again. She was still there, looking
      back at him. It's too late to turn back
      now, Sofie needs to know.

      "So..." Walg started.

      "So...?" Sofie repeated.


      "Sofie, I need to tell you something."

      Sofie's eyes grew in porportion, to her
      immeasurable disbelief. But instead of being scared,
      she started jumping merrily around.

      "You can speak, you can speak, oh
      my god." she exclaimed and laughed.

      "This is amazing, am I dreaming? I
      have gone mad, haven't I? I knew
      something was wrong with me."

      "Calm down Sofie. You are not dreaming
      and you're not crazy. I'm speaking
      for real."

      "Right, right, right. Sorry, I
      think I need to lie down."

      She sat down, and took several
      deep breaths. In the back of her
      mind, she still somehow think she
      blew a couple of fuses in the head.
      She pinched herself again, in various
      places.

      "Listen, Sofie, you're not going mad.
      It's all true, I can speak and understand
      you."

      "Oh wow, really? But how can you only speak
      now, what about all this time we've been together?"

      Walg took his time, and slowly explained
      everything. Sofie sat in silence, trying
      to absorb all what Walg said. It was
      world shattering, it's like everything
      she knew was wrong. The rest of day
      went by, slightly absent minded.
      Of course, she kept speaking with Walg
      all the while, but the way she spoke
      became more stiff and formal, like
      she was now speaking to a stranger,
      not like the friend or family she knew.

      A week had passed since. She started to
      open up to Walg again, accepting the
      twisted reality as it is. In time,
      she spoke more naturally again, saying
      every bit of her thought process to
      Walg, who for the most part, just
      listened, like always. About a month
      later, they were back to once they were,
      the three of them, enjoying the company
      of each other.

      The more Walf spoke,
      the more Sofie was convinced that Walg
      was smarter than her, maybe way more
      than she can imagine. Sofie thought
      it was a waste that Walg would just
      spend time with her. She thought
      Walg could realize his full potential
      if he could hang out with the right people,
      people who knew better, people
      who knows what to do in case
      a non-human sentient creature
      emerges out of nowhere.

      More than that, Sofie wanted
      more people to know about Walg,
      what a funny and wonderful bird
      he is. Surely kids and everyone
      would love to meet Walghvoghel, the
      magical speaking bird. She would need
      to find a way to get to
      Mauritius island anyway. If
      she could find the right people,
      then things would a lot easier.
      To find people, the easiest way
      is to draw people in.
      Thus, Sofie concluded, that
      people must know about Walg.
      She defied Walg's warning about
      not telling anyone about him.
      She couldn't quite understand
      his reasoning, and just assumed
      instead that Walg was just
      shy around people.

      After some lengthy back and forth
      arguing with Walg, Sofie finally
      convinced Walg to meet with the
      one her former colleague, a philosopher
      of nature. By similar process,
      the philosopher would through
      stages of doubt and madness,
      but in the end accepted the
      state of reality. From there on,
      word slowly have spread, from
      the colleagues of the philosopher,
      to friends, to family. It came
      to a point until the rumor
      of a talking bird finally reached
      the ears of ignorant street
      paupers.

      Sofie was regularly visited
      by a curious bunch, in increarsing
      volume each day. Walg became
      a metaphorical crowd drawing panda,
      attending to an witless audience
      who would go crazy even at the utterance
      of household words. Was I wrong
      about them? Do human really have
      higher-consciousness? Sofie,
      on the other hand, had a big smile
      on her face seeing how people
      adored her Walg.


      It was a happy ending after all,
      thought Walg. He was just overthinking
      it, it appears to be.

      ⁂

      After the initial hype died down,
      self proclaimed philosophers and experts
      from neighbouring towns started visiting,
      and requested consultation with the
      sentient bird.

      Not everyone was delighted to
      learn about the existence of Walghvoghel.
      The subset of the population that
      Walg was afraid about. It was
      the people that adhered strictly
      to the encoded dogmatic words that
      dictated what they should believe.
      It was the Church of Welzijn,
      a recently established group
      that aims to prosper the well-being
      of mankind.

      It didn't take much effort
      for the Welzijn to convince
      people that Walghvoghel was a
      reincarnated devil. Of course, the
      Church's real reason is that a talking
      bird contradicts their very teachings,
      the belief that human beings
      are the children of god, and animals
      exists only to serve man alone.

      The people who held a more rational
      point of view also supported this propaganda
      against the devil,
      albeit for an entirely different motive.
      The existence sentient bird would threaten
      the profitability of poultry farming.
      They believe that people would entirely
      stop eating birds and chickens.
      It would come to a point that people
      would altogether stop eating any meat.
      It would kill the whole industry within
      a year. Society could potentially
      collapse.

      Another faction of philosophers
      has a different concern.
      They theorized that extremists would then take
      the conclusion further and argue
      that every life on earth has consciousness,
      dogs, grasses, worms, sky and the earth.
      An entirely new religion or philosophy
      would be established and will dominate worldwide.
      It greatly tip the balance of power and influence,
      resulting to more possible wars and destabilization.

      Different groups and factions, all implicitly
      and unanimously agreed that the speaking bird
      is a devil incarnate and must be destroyed,
      and must be banished from the future history,
      from people's mind and memory. The real
      devil was Sofie, the crazy woman, who spread
      lies for fame and fortune.

      With the support of the Church and various
      concered groups, the government
      promptly took action to eliminate the threat.
      Propaganda and misinformation was spread throughout.
      It was then mandated that every bird that resembled
      the speaking bird must be killed without question.
      Hired assassins, in the guise of yet another
      visiting philosophers, visited Sofie's home
      one early morning. They knocked, intruded without
      invitation, only to find an empty house with
      no one around.

      ⁂

      Hang on, I'm the protagonist here. Where's
      my airtime? All that story development,
      what's in it for me? Where do I fit in?
      Those questions popped in my head as
      Aunt Sofie incessantly loredumped with her
      slice of life story, starring Kenchi
      the magical speaking chicken.

      As a matter of fact, I do played
      a role. Or not me, Rutger did.
      During that time, I was enlisted
      as one of the military dogs. In one
      briefing, I overheard about a lone,
      crazy woman named Sofie who
      was about to be eliminated. There
      wasn't a lot of people who fit
      that profile, so I was sure that
      they were referring to my Aunt Sofie.

      Late at night, I warned Sofie about
      her impending doom, and accompanied
      her to escape along with the bird.
      That night was their only chance
      to escape, the following morning
      she'd either be dead, or have
      no chance getting away since
      the military will immediately
      deploy checkpoints all over
      the place. She stole a boat
      by the port, and floated away.
      She didn't know what happened to
      me afterwards that. She could
      not get to Mauritius on that
      boat alone though, she would
      need to a ship for that. She
      didn't really explain much
      in detail how she got to
      Mauritius, but I guess that
      wasn't really important.
      She was looking really tired
      too after speaking that much,
      so I had to leave her to rest.

      Hopefully I'm being a reliable
      narrator here, I'm doing my best
      to retell everything what Aunt Sofie
      told me. Things are more or less
      clear now, but there's
      a lot of things that I still
      don't understand.

      For one, how come suddenly
      people could just agree that
      that dumb looking bird needs
      to die just because it started
      speaking? Sure, there would
      unforeseen implications, but
      is it really that a big deal?
      There some degree of absurdity
      to it, the image of humans
      and big chickens coexisting
      together, big chickens
      going to work,
      big chickens going to school
      alongside children, big chickens
      teaching the children,
      big chickens
      participating on polictical
      discourse on national television,
      big chickens putting people out
      of work...?

      Okay, I admit there might
      be complications. It's not
      actually hard to see that
      sooner or later, otherkens
      start demanding and fighting
      for their rights. From oppressed
      minority, to world leaders.
      Big chickens dominating the world.
      Soon there will be interspecies-wars,
      and at that point, we have already lost.

      I concede then. Dismissing the consequences
      as mere unforeseen implications is short-sighted.
      I'm not in the position to question the authority
      for taking immediate actions, but I also think
      that mass extermination is too extreme.
      Perhaps a middle-ground solution, like
      controlling their habitat and putting
      them under strict observation. They dont't have
      to kill Kenchi, he's more human than
      a human, as Aunt Sofie says.

      Putting that aside, the next question
      is then: what am I doing here?
      What I, Rutger of the military ranks,
      am doing here working with the hunters?
      What exactly was I hired for? Did I
      pretend to be a hunter so I could
      find Sofie if she's alright? That
      seems possible.

      But there's one more thing: it
      doesn't look like Cat, Van or
      even that Gregscum knows the
      true nature of dodaars. They only
      described dodaars as intelligent
      and dangerous. They wouldn't
      omit a vital information that
      dodaars are equal or exceeds
      human intellect. They don't
      know that they speak, and
      can devise plans that could
      wipe every invader in this island.

      What this all means is that
      they weren't told any of this.
      Hunters were just hired to hunt
      chickens as a covert operation
      to make them all extinct.

      I see, it makes sense now.
      Why they are needlessly chopping
      trees way more than needed?
      To incur ecological
      destruction, to destroy their
      natural habitat. The
      wood choppers were part of the
      grander scheme. No one is
      told anything of the real plan.
      The plan after all, is to wipe
      everything in existence, both
      in physical and mental space.
      No one must know, no one must remember.

      The dodo birds will then be a small footprint
      in history, the following generations
      will be told of a story of a wingless
      bird that went extinct because
      they were dumb animals that were
      too stupid to ran away from predators.

      History. It's the history I'm told.
      I'm reliving history. Thomas of
      the modern times, Thomas who secluded
      himself inside because technology
      advanced enough to deter the need
      to go outside. I, Thomas the lab
      assitant, got transported back
      to the past, around the year 1600.

      ⁂

      I didn't get to ask Aunt Sofie
      for more information, but I
      did managed to ask some important
      details. A confirmation that
      doesn't really inspire me more.
      I asked her about this world,
      what year and what amazing
      creatures are there? I asked
      do you have magic in this world?

      All she said was no. She repeated
      it several times. No.

      "What happened to you, Rutgar?
      Magic? What nonsense are you talking
      about? Do you need help Rutgar?"

      It was mildly insulting to hear
      that from someone who spent years.
      talking to an unresponsive chicken.
      I wasn't able to ask any questions
      after that as she felt really tired
      and needed to rest.

      She didn't need me to tell what year
      is this. I roughly know about dodo
      bird's timeline by asking Tim during
      his break. The clothing, the houses,
      it's all in trend with the colonial period.
      I didn't remember the island's name though,
      but now I'm sure it's called Mauritius.

      Which brings me to the most important
      point: is this isekai? Can I really
      call this isekai? No, not even close.
      This is a regular time travelling
      story. This is like the regular world,
      only worse. What do people even do
      in this times? Nothing. I'll be bored
      out of my mind soon enough. At
      least this isn't the world war era.

      But why though? Isekai or not,
      why I did I get sent to the past?
      I know, maybe, just maybe, Bob
      and the other one managed to build
      a time machine, and I was the
      very first human being to try their
      latest invention. Of course,
      being the mad scientist they are,
      something was bound to go wrong.
      So, instead of sending me to
      the future where every problems
      in the world is solved, I
      was sent to the past instead,
      as a side-punishment for my
      useless self.

      Great, first talking chickens,
      now time machines? What's next?
      Oh I know, please please let
      there be Catgirls. I mean, come on,
      time machines and talking chickens
      are nothing compared to catgirls.
      Catgirls are pretty mundane all
      crazy things considered. Fuck
      historical inaccuries. History books
      are a lie, just like the fat history
      teachers that gave me an F are a lie.
      Absense of proof is not proof of absense.
      History failed to tell the tales of
      talking chickens. Who's to say
      there never was catgirls? Just to
      be precise, in case Jesus of Africa
      is eavesdropping, Catgirls are moemoe
      girls in cute dress and have cat ears
      that matches their hair color. The
      ears doesn't strictly have to be
      cat ears though.

      I'm losing it.
      I'm not totally a lost cause yet though.
      There's still hope. If I got here by
      time machine, there's chance that
      I can get out of here by time machine too.
      Any time now, Bob and Time will appear
      out of nowhere and drag me back to
      present time.

      That settles it then.
      I'll I have to do is to avoid dying
      at all cost. Forget this crazy hunting
      mission. I'm going back home...

      Then it occured to me.
      No, I can't go back at my Sofie's home,
      not anywhere.
      I undertand now why would
      be a military dog like me would be
      hired as a hunter. Rutger's real
      goal is likely to eliminate Kenshi,
      the one who's leading the dodaars.

      There's no way out.
      I went AWOL as an undercover
      hunter. The military will hand
      me my ass back, in pieces,
      buried across the island.
      It's likely Rutger was
      one of the few people who
      knows the true confidentiality
      of this mission. They won't
      let me live. Mission fail,
      mission success, they will
      dispose of me either ways
      when it's over. I'm fucked.

      That won't happen though.
      Aside from the time machine,
      I can still get out of this alive
      by serving under Kenchi's rule.
      I have no choice but betray
      humanity and side with otherkens.
      They will protect me, and
      I will assist them to victory.
      To a future where mankind
      may cease to exist.

      ⁂

      I couldn't sleep, or even take
      a slight break. Not because it
      was still mid-morning, but due
      to sheer amount of details
      to process. Normally, I just
      try to sleep this one out
      and let my subconsious mind
      untangle the maze. But the
      longer I wait it out, the
      less possible actions to take.

      I decided to just walk around the
      castle. Looking closer, I notice
      that the castle is actually
      more of a refurbished ruins. There
      are moulds growing everywhere,
      some walls have collapsed. I
      believe the castle dates back
      to the medieval period? Wait,
      why is there a castle here in
      the first place? I thought
      no one lives here before it
      was discovered?

      I saw some pair of otherkens
      marching. They appear to be
      on guard duty. They made
      chicken sounds I they pass
      me by. I saluted back with
      their language, I sounded
      more like a duck. The castle
      may be medieval or some sort,
      but I think it will hold just
      fine against most types of
      assault. What I'm worried about
      is whether the otherkens can
      actually fight in any way.
      If anything, they look like
      they'd even lose to a rooster
      on a 1v1 battle. They are big,
      but not big enough against humans.

      Then I remember once again
      about Van and Cat's warning
      about the dodaars having taken
      a dozen of full grown men.
      I will just have to believe in that
      anecdote, the otherkens may
      indeed have the means of fighting back.

      I got to the main hallway of the
      castle. I should have a talk
      with Kenchi for the next moves,
      but before that I need to decide
      what should I do with Van and Cat.
      If I abandon them, there's a good
      chance they'll die. Even if I
      only knew them for a short time,
      they were good people, and we
      shared meals together. The
      thought of them dying because
      of me will inflict guilt upon
      me. More than that, they may
      serve as valuable allies in this
      conflict between apes and bird.
      It's not like I just want to
      see Cat again while making
      a series of convoluted excuses.
      They are just regular hunters
      after all, they unknowingly
      got involved into this mess,
      so there's no reason they'd
      maintain loyalty on the opposing
      side.

      With that all in mind, I decided
      to head back out at the river,
      on the tree tower. There's
      a good chance I might come across
      them on the way. Heck, they might
      already be lurking behind the bushes
      near the castle. I exited the castle
      and traced my way back at the town
      entrace. I heard chicken sounds
      calling out to me right before
      I could walk.

      It was Kent, I think?

      "Hey Kent. I'll be heading
      back to the river to get my friends
      back. I can convince them to join us."

      Maybe-kent made chicken sounds.

      "Forrow, I frow yuu"

      "You'll come with me? Alright,
      I see no problem with that."

      And so we marched back to the
      town entrace, and then took
      the same previous route to
      the river. Pretty sure this
      is Kent. I don't know, I just
      know it's Kent.

      We were almost back at the river
      when Kent made alarmed chicken
      sounds. I heed the caution and
      crouched behind the tree.

      "What's wrong Kent?"

      But before he could speak,
      an arrow pierced cleanly
      through Kent's head, right
      in between the eye. Kent
      collapsed on the ground,
      dark colored red oozes
      on the ground.

      "No!" I cried.

      "Who's there? Show yourselves
      cowards" I challenged the
      assailants.

      "Tom! It's us"

      Then a figure emerged behind
      the bush corner. It was Van.

      "Good thing you're safe.
      I knew you were taken hostage."

      No, you got that wrong. My eyes
      searched for Cat, I'm sure
      she's the one who took that
      shot.

      "Where's Cat?"

      "I'm here, Tom" says Cat, she
      jumped down from the tree
      above.

      We regrouped together,
      staring at the dodo bird
      on the ground. Why did
      this happen? I didn't expect
      this to happen.

      "These dodaars went down easier
      than I expected. I thought
      they'd be tougher than that."
      says Van.

      It was probably because Kent
      was thinking you guys were not
      hostile. I told Kent you guys
      are my friends.

      "Cat, Van, you got it wrong.
      This is not−"

      A loud screeched startled us.
      Kent rose from the dead,
      with arrow still between his eyes,
      without warning he attacked
      Van. His movements resembled
      to a Taekwondo jin, Kent
      did a three-hit bullet kick
      on Van's body, and a final
      roundhouse on the head.
      It happened so fast Van
      had no time to react.
      Van was now on the ground,
      unconcious.

      Cat immediately fired a shot
      right after Van collapsed.
      She aimed for the head again,
      but missed. Kent moved at
      an inhuman speed, he strafed
      side to side while closing the
      distance to attack. Cat fired
      several shots, but all were
      a miss. Kent was now in the
      striking range after the
      last shot. He landed a kick
      on Cat's arm, causing her
      the drop the bow. She cried
      in pain. I stepped in time
      before Kent could deliver
      a fatal blow.

      "Stop!" I stood in front
      of Cat, with my hands wrapped
      around her.

      "That's enough, Kent. They
      didn't mean to attack."

      Kent still focused his killer
      predator eyes on Cat,
      something I never thought I
      would see from the these docile
      looking birds.

      Kent is actually one of the larger
      dodaars. The dodaars in the town
      village are the shorter and
      fatter ones. Kent and most of the
      otherkens in the castle are
      taller and slimmer.

      This explains why I have
      a hard time viewing them
      as anything as other than preys.
      When I think of dodo bird, I
      think of the shorter and fatter ones,
      the ones typically portrayed in history.
      Looking at Kent closer here though,
      it's clear that his build is entirely
      different.

      I guess this is anologous to ants
      having worker ants and the soldier
      ants? Or maybe male dodaars are
      just the larger variants, and
      the smaller, chubbier ones are
      the females. Even humans have
      fat chubby ones, and the large
      figher ones.

      In any case, dodaars are definitely
      not to be underestimated. Then again,
      it's actually me who's making fun
      of the big chickens. No, there's
      no contradiction. Dodaars are the
      soldier dodos, and the otherkens are
      the lesser chickens. I still get
      to keep them calling chickens without
      disparaging their combat skills.

      Kent finally stood down, shifting
      to his regular dorky stance.
      He made several chicken sounds,
      it means something but I don't
      know.

      I turned around and faced Cat.
      She looks hurt. I gave her a
      bear hug. She didn't resist,
      but only occured to me after
      the fact that maybe hugging
      isn't quite the right gesture?
      She smelt nice and felt
      really soft though, especially
      on her private areas.

      Shit, I'm letting my primal
      brains takeover me again.

      "Are you alright?"

      "Yes, my arm just hurts a bit"

      Her left arm looks a bit red,
      but it doesn't seem swollen
      or anything. I think Van needs
      more immediate medical attention.
      He's unconsious, which really can't
      be a good sign. I tapped him
      in the cheeks.

      "Hey, Van, you alright?"

      He blinked several times.

      "Huh? Where am I? What happened?"

      He tried to get up, but I
      stopped him, and just let
      him sit for a while. He slowly
      shook his head and looked around.

      "You got knocked out by a chicken."

      He tensed up as soon as he remembered.

      "No, no, it's alright, he's not an
      enemy. Relax."

      Van gave the Kent a threatening look.

      "Do you mind explaining Tom? You
      can start by explaining why is
      that bird still alive."

      "I really don't know too. But
      I can assure you he's not our
      enemy."

      I considered asking Kent, but
      he's not that proficient yet
      with speaking. I stepped
      closer and inspected his
      bloody head. I touched
      the arrow and yanked it a
      bit. Kent cried out in pain.

      "Sorry." I apologized to the
      chicken.

      "I can explain everything later.
      We should head into the town."

      "Town? What town?"

      "Just come on"

      I internally played the dragon
      quest music in my head, that
      one long music when a new party
      member joins. Or is it
      final fantasy I'm humming right now.

      "What are you spacing out for?" says Van
      and his rude interruptions.

      "Nothing. Let's go"

      And so marched back to the town,
      with Kent the arrowhead in the lead.
      I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
      starting to enjoy the unexpected
      turn of events.
      It was starting to feel like an
      actual adventure.

      Van had the same reactions as
      I did when I first entered the
      chicken town, only he was more
      louder and agitated. Even Cat
      looks excited and confused at
      the same time. I refrained
      attending any of their questions
      and insist Cat and Van to keep
      walking, only because Kent wouldn't
      stop walking either.

      When we finally got to the Castle,
      Van's mind was further blown,
      and now he was louder than before.
      Cat was silent, but I can tell
      she's internally blown as well.

      Without pause, we headed directly
      to throneroom. Except Kenchi
      was not there standing awkwardly
      at the royal seat. Kenchi was nowhere
      to be seen, so an Otherken approached
      Kent, they made chicken sounds at
      each other.

      The otherken faced us and said "Ryuu Wayrrt"

      "You wait" I translate it for Cat and Van.
      Then Kent proceeded to walk to the room
      on the left.

      "D-did that dodaar just spoke right now?
      Or did I hit my head too hard." says Van,
      who now seems to be undergoing various
      crisis right now. I didn't say anything.

      We entered a room, larger than the one I
      rested on, and had several beds in it.

      "Looks like the boss is out somewhere.
      You should rest for now, especially
      you Van."

      Van lied down the bed without a word.
      He had his hand on his head, probably
      feeling the bump somewhere.

      If anything though, it's Kent that
      should be lying on the bed or
      wherever they sleep. How do
      they sleep, now that I think about it.
      More importantly, how is he still
      alive? No bird or anything with
      brains should be alive after a
      headshot like that. The arrowhead
      is sticking out on the back of his
      head, so there's no way that was
      just a blunt.

      I sat on the bed while I hopelessly try
      to work out an answer. I gave up
      and instead watched Cat. She
      sat in the other bed next to me.
      She's examining her left arm,
      trying to gauge the possible
      damage she received. I think
      she's alright though, it doesn't
      look sprained or swollen. As if
      Cat heard my thought, she put down her
      arm and looked at me instead.
      She's now looking directly at
      my eyes, which admittedly made
      me nervous. I could only look
      for several seconds before I
      looked away. By away, I mean
      downwards, where now my eyes
      locked on her thighs and slit of
      grail
      that exists in between.

      At this point, I'm convinced
      that I'm either iredeemable
      pervert, or that Cat is
      seductively attractive that
      is impossible to ignore.
      I couldn't look away, I
      was hopeless.

      I was about to lose myself,
      when a chicken tapped
      on the door, made chicken
      sounds intrusively,
      instantly killing the mood.
      I saw Cat abruptly closed her legs
      together, put her hands
      on her thighs, and she looked
      away blushing. I wanted
      to punch the chicken, but
      I couldn't immediately
      just get up for unmentionable
      reasons.

      It was Kent again, I think.
      He held a basket of fruits, and
      handed it to Cat. He made
      chicken sounds as he left
      the room. Cat handed me
      a green, roundish fruit.

      "Here you go, Tom".

      "Thanks" as I took a bite.
      I believe these things are
      called mangoes, although
      I thought mangoes were a
      bit more oval in shape. Must
      be another local variety.
      Cat left the basket sit
      on her lap, covering
      what must be covered.
      She ate the apple in silence
      as she look outside the
      window.

      The perverse desire is more
      or less gone now, so I
      lay down the bed as I
      finish the mango with
      the last bite.

      "What are you guys eating?"
      Van says, who seems to have
      been completely left out.

      Cat threw an apple to Van,
      to which I heard a slapping
      catch sound. Van got the
      crunchy one.

      "So Tom, you planning on
      telling us what's going on?"

      ⁂

      There wasn't much left to tell
      Cat and Van, in addition to
      what they have already seen here.
      I considered if I
      should omit some details that
      they shouldn't know for their
      own safety, but they will likely
      learn those things on their own
      even if they remain on the opposing
      side, as the hunters that
      were hired by the military.
      Besides, lying or hiding
      crucial information would only
      wound the trust between us.
      I can trust them, and they
      could trust me.

      So we gathered around, sitting
      on the bed, with me re-telling
      everything what Aunt Sofie told
      me. Some parts were hard to
      understand, even for me as
      someone who was somewhat educated
      with rigours of modern wisdom,
      but I did my best to explain
      it to them in my own words.
      Add to that what Rutger leaked
      from the military confidentials,
      there's a lot details that may
      have been inaccurate I'm sure.

      "What chickens? What are you talking about?
      They look nothing like chickens." Van
      openly rebutted me at one point.
      It was about the least important part,
      but I call certainly see where he's coming from.
      As much I like to prove him wrong, I
      continued narrating anyway. At
      least Cat got a bit of laughter from it.
      I'm certain that Cat shares my vision,
      and that they look everything like chickens.

      I was pretty much fixated on Cat
      on the whole time while I was narrating,
      I tried my best to look at her in
      the eyes, yet my eyes occasionally
      diverted to the forbidden regions.
      Van held the fruit basket, making
      louds of crunching sounds while
      eating most of it.

      I snatched the remaining guava from
      the fruit basket as I concluded my
      briefing. Their faces were all
      screwed over, overall not satisifed
      with the explanation. Anyways, I
      did my best to tell them everything
      I know. But I should just tell
      them a high-level summary just
      to be sure we're on the same page.

      "So... this means we save the big chickens
      because it's not fair that we
      kill of them just because they can speak?"
      Cat says, trying her best to
      make sense of it. It's close to
      what I was about to say.

      Van finally broke his silence,
      as if getting the general gist of it.

      "What? That's not right! Don't
      call them chickens. D-o-d-a-a-r-s.
      They are dodaars, not chickens."

      Looks like Van might be a bit difficult
      to recruit.

      "Grilled chickens are my favorite,
      I've eating them as long as I can remember.
      It just feels wrong, it's like all
      this time I've been commiting crimes
      against humanity."

      Point taken, Van. Very good, salient point.
      I've been humorously calling them chicken,
      but it does seem insensitive to joke
      about it in hindsight. Similarities
      are merely superficial, dodaars are
      on another level of consciousness.

      "You're right, Van. It's not right
      to call them chickens." But I'm
      not going down without a fight.
      I'm after all an ex-soldier Yager,
      whatever that means.

      "We call them otherkens instead" I said,
      offering a decent compromise.

      "Udderkens? They do look like cows,
      I guess...? Okay, Udderkens it is. I
      don't like cows very much anyway."

      I have the sinking suspicion that
      we are having a tiny little bit
      of misunderstanding here, but
      I feel like I will permanently
      unable to recover my dignity
      if I press on.

      "So we're all clear then?
      We will be fighting with
      the otherkens. We can't
      go back because they will
      kill us too, sooner or later."

      Cat nodded back to me. Van,
      on the other hand, still
      seems to be reluctant.
      He was shaking his leg,
      and scratching his head.

      "What about the others?
      They will get killed too.
      Gregor is my buddy, I can
      convince him and the
      rest of the hunters to join us."

      This will complicate a lot
      of the plans. I didn't bother
      including the others because,
      for one, I don't know them.
      They won't care about me,
      just as I won't care about
      them. As much as I want
      to save all of them, it's
      not possible without compromising
      our own safety. The more
      people included, the more
      chance of betrayal and
      other unaccounted events.

      Most importantly, I don't
      like Greg. I hate him.
      I don't know what his relationship
      with Cat, but I don't care,
      I just hate him regardless.
      I don't trust him, he'll likely
      take command over everything,
      with no room for disgreements.

      "I don't think that's a good
      idea."

      "It's fine, trust me. I can
      do it." Van stood up and paced
      around.

      "It's dangerous. We could get
      killed."

      "Don't worry. I'll just go alone,
      and come back with everyone, I
      promise."

      And that's that. Van has already
      set his mind. I'm not really
      in charge here, so I can't
      just go around ordering people
      what they can't do. I looked
      at Cat, trying to get clues
      from her if that's alright
      with her. She just looked
      back at me without any response.

      "I'm been wondering about this
      for a while now, but what
      relationship do you guys have?
      Siblings?"

      "Siblings? Yeah, well, kind of.
      Maybe cousins. I don't know."
      Said Van.

      "You don't know?"

      "Our village burned down when
      we were kids. A lot of people
      have died, children were orphaned.
      We don't know who were our parents."
      Cat says.

      "It doesn't matter though. We're
      siblings no matter what. I treat
      her like my very own little sister."
      Van says, as he leaned on Cat's
      shoulder.

      "I know what you are thinking.
      It's fine, you can leer with
      Cat all you want." Van says
      suggestively, lifting her
      skirt a little bit for me
      to peek.

      "Vanderbilt!" says Cat both
      angrily and ashamedly.

      "Don't let Gregor catch you
      though, he's gonna mincemeat
      you like a dodaars."

      Son of a Kvetch. This Vandodoor
      knows everything from the start.
      I stood up and made excuses
      to do something. I left the room
      and subconsiously walked somewhere
      else. I don't know if I should
      be ashamed for being an obvious creep, or
      angry at the thought of that Gregscum
      spooning my dear Cat.

      I don't care one bit if the otherkens
      kick the living daylights out of
      that gregshit. I bet all my life savings
      that Greg can't win against Kent
      one on one.

      Speaking of which, where's Kent?
      How is he still alive again?
      I searched around, looking
      for an otherken with an arrow
      on its head. I peered room by
      room, until I got to Sofie's
      room. I took a peek just in
      case, and I saw Kenchi
      standing on the stool
      next to Sofie.

      ⁂

      Walghvoghel stood in contemplative
      silence as he stared blankly
      at Solfie. There was no words,
      Aunt Sofie was not moving,
      not a single breath. I have
      no memory of Sofie as her
      newphew, I'm not supposed
      to feel anything, I don't
      know her. But why do I feel
      like shit? The way she
      told me about her life,
      how she lived her life in
      isolation from others, maybe
      that somehow made me feel
      connected, and that connection
      is now pulling my soul
      to the remorsing void. She
      deserved a better life, she's
      still young, she could have
      years more of a bountiful life.
      Yet, she's no longer with us.

      I'm not a religious person,
      I hate how religion evolved
      to a rhetorical device that controls my
      thoughts. But that doesn't
      mean I'm an atheist. For one,
      a lot of atheist I know aren't
      very bright, people who
      proudly denounces the existence
      of god for the sake of superficially
      increasing their would-be
      intelligence. They act like
      they have everything figured
      it out, they built these
      walls around their imaginative
      capacity that establish
      what's possible. These
      kind of atheists worship
      science as their new religion,
      in actuality something they
      equally know nothing about.
      I know such people exists,
      because I was one of them.

      But being an atheist does
      nothing for me.
      If I had the choice,
      why would I believe in
      a reality devoid of meaning.
      Live then let die, then what.
      Just skip to the ending,
      why are you still here.
      No, at the risk of being
      called delusional, I'd
      rather believe there's
      more to it, that there's
      still something beyond
      that we don't understand.
      Mankind has gone a long way,
      but we have by no means
      figured everything out.
      We don't know how life
      works, how the universe works.
      There's still a lot of
      space for believing in
      divine beings that oversee us.
      Maybe, if mankind got to a point
      where we could make general
      artificial intelligence, I
      could reconsider my position,
      maybe.

      But at this moment, I'm going
      to believe. Sofie is in better place
      now, she's happy and smiling,
      she has no regrets. Those
      she left behind will carry on,
      making sure that her deeds will
      not lay waste.

      I don't know how long I stood
      there, but Walghvoghel started
      moving. He looked behind, and
      saw me.

      "Oh, it's you, Rutger. Come sit."

      Kenchi jumped down on the floor.

      "No, it's alright. I shouldn't
      be here."

      "I see. I don't claim to understand how
      humans feel, so you are free to
      act how you feel."

      Kenchi walked towards me.

      "Sofie died just now. But right
      before she slept, she told me
      to explain everything to you.
      So let us be on the way."

      "Wait, don't you feel sad?"

      "Sad? Sofie sometimes say that
      word when she looks at the
      garden, on the part where a stone
      pillar stood. I don't know if I'm sad,
      but some parts of my body are
      hurting right now."

      He didn't need to say more.
      I let him pass through the door
      and see him head to the throneroom.
      I slowly closed the door behind me.
      Farewell Sofie, may we someday
      meet again.

      ⁂

      I went back to the room where
      Van and Cat was staying. Cat
      was lying on the bed, but
      Van was nowhere to be seen.
      It wasn't unsual for him to
      missing somewhere, but in
      this case, he may actually
      have already left to get Gregor and
      the others. I went to Cat,
      and see her resting beautiful face.
      She was asleep. I stood beside
      her for a while, just watching
      her. I shouldn't disturb Cat,
      just let her rest for now.
      I'll tell later them what Kenchi
      told me.

      I quietly left the room, and
      headed back to the throneroom.
      Kenchi stood on the thone,
      with Kent the arrowhead on
      the side. Kent spoke otherken,
      to me or to Kenchi.

      "Well then, let's get started.
      I don't know how much Sofie has
      told you, so why don't you start
      with the questions, Rutger."

      What else do I need to know?
      My mind isn't really here right now,
      I'd rather just not do anything
      at the moment. Now, I have no hobbies
      to escape to when I'm feeling down.
      I should just go back to bed
      next to Cat. What should I ask?

      "What's this place? A castle?"

      "Castle? I don't know. We just
      moved here."

      "And all the houses outside?"

      "Same. They were here before.
      We just found them and gathered
      all the griffeendts here."

      That's strange, I thought no
      humans lived here before.

      "But you did see people live here?"

      "None, ever. But one of the elder
      griffeendts may know something."

      "You never asked?"

      "I haven't yet, there just too
      much other things to do first
      when me and Sofie got back here."

      Kenchi spoke otherken to Kent,
      and Kent left the room afterwards.

      "I asked him to find the elder.
      Do you have any other questions?"

      I thought of just exploring
      the whole place and maybe find
      books or journals lying around.
      But that can wait for later.

      "Where are the other dodaars
      going? Why are they crossing the river?"

      "We are taking refuge to a safer place."

      "Isn't this place safe enough?"

      "Not safe enough. It's easy to find,
      and we could easy be outnumbered
      and be surrounded here."

      "There's not a lot of hunters though.
      You can just take them all out."

      "No, but human population easily
      exceeds our numbers. Once the
      soldiers are prepared, they will
      attack this place and leave nothing
      alive."

      "But this place is still safer than
      anywhere else. Where can you escape to?"

      "There is a place. It's hard to find,
      has rich foliage and easy to escape
      from humans just in case."

      "On the dark forest?"

      "Past and beyond that dark forest."

      The plan makes sense, sort of,
      I wonder what kind of place is that
      though.

      "But don't birds have difficulty
      seeing in the dark, moreso than
      humans?"

      "We don't need to see that path,
      the scouts has memoried the route.
      And we can use our sense of smell
      if needed."

      "Okay, but how did you find that
      route in the first place"

      Kenchi made otherken sounds,
      maybe that was a laughing sound.
      "Inquisitive, aren't we? We have
      scouts everywhere, they explore
      every corner of the island.
      If it's too dark, they will
      smell their way through."

      "But I heard from my friends that
      the forest is dangerous."

      "Dangerous? For us griffeendts,
      the only danger here are the humans.
      We used to walk the whole island without
      getting a single scratch."

      "That's odd, what's attacking
      the hunters then?"

      "Don't know, it could be the
      insect eaters."

      "I-insect eaters? What's that?"

      "Humans like you, but nothing like you."

      "Meaning?"

      "They have different color, and
      don't like the sun. And they like
      to chase people, it seems."

      I tried to think of what animal
      is that. Monkeys perhaps? I
      know a bit of history about
      this island. It was one time
      called the island of the
      monkeys. Or gorillas?

      "So the insect-eaters don't attack you?
      At all?"

      "No. They don't attack anything actually,
      except maybe you people.
      They've been here long before
      us as far as I can tell."

      "You have seen one yourself?"

      "Yes, when I was younger. The
      younger griffeendts likes to
      play with the insect-eaters."

      We'll if what Kenchi tells me is
      true, then this insect-eater at
      least smart enough not to attack
      indiscriminately. If we are on
      the otherken's side, then it
      might be safe to bet that
      we aren't going to be attacked
      too. Hopefully.

      They wouldn' be worried about
      getting attacked anyway.
      Don't otherkens have 10 lives
      or something?

      "Actually, there's one question
      I've been wanting to ask now."

      "I'm all ears"

      "How is Kent is still alive?"

      "Kent?"

      "I mean, the doddaar here with
      an arrow on its head."

      Both kens in the room spoke
      otherkens.

      "Interesting names you give
      us, Rutger. As for your question,
      no, I don't think this is enough to
      kill us. Humans don't die from
      getting hit in the arm, do they?"

      "No, but we die when we get a
      direct hit in the head. Most
      animals with brains do."

      "Oh, I see. I understand what
      you are saying now. I believe
      Sofie has told me the answer
      before. One time, when a griffeendt
      fell ill and died, Sofie politely
      asked if she could study the remains.
      You humans are certainly weird
      creatures."

      "And? What did she find?"

      "We griffeendts have two brains.
      One in the head, and another in
      the body, around somewhere
      the heart."

      "What? Seriously? That's, that's
      crazy and awesome! Fucking amazing!"

      That explains it, that explains
      a lot of things. I also feel cheated.
      Sometimes, I think half of my brains
      doesn't even work right, yet look
      at these double-brained chickens.
      No wonder can speak and learn like
      humans. Judging how fat these birds
      are, I'm guessing their body-brain
      size aren't trivial either, maybe
      as large or larger than humans.

      There's also one other thing
      that I feel cheated about. It
      bothers me how this seemingly
      fantasy isekai land are actually
      bounded by laws of nature and
      physics, just like everything else.
      Things that seem abnormal at first
      actually has a perfectly valid
      explanation. There's no magic
      here. These otherkens can talk
      not just because, but there's a
      logical explanation why they can
      talk. My point being, if I'm
      here, then there must be a
      perfectly logical explanation.

      Then again, why am I Rutger?
      If I traveled here by time machine,
      why would I be someone else?
      Is it just mere coincidence that
      I look exactly like Rutger?

      "No more questions, Rutger?"

      "What about me, and the other
      hunters I brought here? There
      may be more that will come here.
      Will you just let join like that?"

      "I see no problem with that. As
      long as it doesn't outnumber us,
      we will be fine. We can fight too,
      you know."

      "But there's a chance they burn everything,
      bomb this place into oblivion. The only
      safe escape is out of this island."

      "They wouldn't do that yet, not in the
      current time at least. Sophie mentioned
      once the political climate, they wouldn't
      spend carelessly spend that much resource
      when a possible war is impending."

      "But still..."

      "No worries, Rutger. Forest fires
      are almost non-existent here. Rainfall
      are frequent, even in summer. The soils
      are never dry. Even if a fire do break out,
      we can take some action to put it out.
      For now, our best action is to take refuge,
      and be on the defensive."

      I'm not entirely convinced, but it appears
      that Kenchi at least thoroughly considered
      the factors at play. I will just have
      to go with it. What do else do I need
      to know? I still have lots to ask actually,
      but...

      "Can you speak to other birds?"

      "No, in the same way you can't speak
      to monkeys. But I believe humans can
      learn how to speak griffeendt, it's after all a
      simpler and more primitive language.
      Sofie managed to learn a bit."

      Interesting. I'm not good with language
      learning though. Even british english
      is hard enough.

      I heard steps from behind. It was
      Kent the arrowhead. Kent the arrowhead
      is a mouthful. I think I call him
      Kentaro now.

      Kentaro walked up to Kenchi and
      spoke to each other.

      "Kent said he found the elder,
      but the elder doesn't want to
      walk. So instead, we go to her."

      "Are you sure you want to leave
      your castle just like that? Don't
      you have to overlook the kingdom
      in some way"

      "No need, griffeendt have always
      been autonomous creatures.
      They do what they need to do without
      being told. I'm more of a herder
      than a king actually, but Sofie
      insisted that I'm a king."

      Kenchi jumped off the throne,
      and marched towards the exit.
      Kentaro and I followed along.
      On the way out, I saw Cat
      standing by the doorway. I
      waved at her and she followed
      along.

      The four of us walked along by the
      delipitated brick road.
      I told Cat everything
      I learned so far. Like me, she
      was quite surprised about the
      otherkens having two brains.
      She didn't really pay much
      attention to the other things I said.
      She walks a bit too close to me
      though, not that I'm complaining
      but I might get weird ideas again.

      Kenchi stopped in front of a house.
      It less of a house actually, and more
      of a wooden square-ish igloo. It's a
      weird house now that I have a closer
      look at it. I couldn't tell if it's
      by design, or that was part of the
      aging process.

      There was no door, a discolored
      cloth just hangs over the entrance.
      Kenchi walked through, and
      we followed inside.

      ⁂

      I don't have a better description
      for the elder, except it looked
      old and tired. It does look like
      a witch without a crazy hat. The
      elder sat on stack of hay on the
      ground. There were no seats, but
      I was tired from all the standing
      and walking, so I just sat on the
      floor. Cat sat next to me, close
      enough that our elbows touch.

      Kentaro stayed out outside.
      Kenchi then started speaking
      to the elder, they exchange
      incomprehensible otherken words.
      Seeing them talk was amusing.
      It's like they are just making
      noises without any semblance
      of intelligent communication.
      The elder spoke slower though.
      I don't really understand anything,
      so I let my focus wander around.
      Since Cat sat real close to me,
      I could actually smell her.
      She does have a distinct smell,
      not foul or anything, just
      something distinct. Do people
      of this time smell like this?
      I guess they don't have soap
      in this era? I kind of like
      the smell, without knowing
      what it is. It's like enticing
      me. Could this smell coming
      from ...

      "The elder said that this place
      was abandoned even she was young.
      But she did see a few colored humans
      live here once, but they left."

      "Colored humans? Like black people?"

      "No, like the insect-eaters."

      "I thought they don't like going
      under the sun?"

      "I'm just merely restating
      what is told. I don't claim irrefutable truth."

      Now I'm really curious about these so called
      insect-eaters.

      "Well, Rutger? Do you want to know more?
      About the insect-eaters?"

      Curiousity aside, what do we get from
      following this lead? Aren't there
      more import things to attend to at
      this moment? Wait, they may actually
      be of help to us.

      "You say insect-eaters used to play with
      you and the younger dodaars. Are they
      sentient, like us? Can they help us?"

      "Maybe, and maybe. Sorry Rutger, I
      really don't know much. I am pretty
      much still a baby when it comes to
      language proficiency. It hasn't
      really occured to me to speak to
      others until recently."

      "No, it's fine. I guess we could
      still try to approach these insect-eaters.
      Even if they can't help, we might learn
      something useful."

      "It's decided then. Tomorrow, Rutger
      and his girlfriend will visit the
      insect-eaters first thing in the morning."

      "No, Cat is not my... Wait, just the two of us?
      What about you?"

      Kenchi spoke otherken as he headed for the door.
      The elder replied back without inaudible.

      "It's decided then. Tomorrow, Rutger
      and his wife, along with Kent, will visit the
      insect-eaters first thing in the morning."

      Kenchi was already outside before he could
      finish his sentence.

      "You..." then I heard Cat giggling a bit.
      Well, I guess it's alright. Cat isn't
      the least offended by it. It was a joke
      after all.

      I made duck noises to give reverence
      to the elder before stepping out.
      We got out and walked back to the castle.

      "What are you going to do tomorrow then?
      How many kens are still here?"

      "Tomorrow will be the last batch of
      griffeendts to move. We will march
      first thing in the morning."

      "The hunters could be preparing an
      an ambush though. I'm not really expecting Van
      to convince the rest to join us."

      "No worries, Rutger. There may be less of us
      left here, but we will still stay on guard
      none the lesser. We also have scouts that
      will report in advance if there's danger
      ahead. We have the upper hand, if anything."

      "Okay, but what about us? Are you really
      just let going to let us go to the insecters?
      Kentaro is strong, but maybe you should add
      a couple more otherkens to my party."

      "Kentaro? Oh, Kent the arrow. Fun names
      you have for us, Rutger. Yes, Kentaro will be
      more than enough. His main purpose is actually
      to guide you there and back to us. Insect-eaters
      won't harm you."

      "How would you know? Van and Cat told me how
      they were attacked in the blind forest before."

      "But you weren't attacked when you last
      went through the forest, right?"

      "Yeah, but Van said that's because they
      used a torch and were very loud, which
      gave away their location."

      "That's were you are wrong, Rutger.
      Insect-easters mostly live in the dark,
      meaning they can see in the dark.
      The insect-eaters know your precise
      location the moment you stepped in that
      forest, noise or light won't make
      a difference."

      I didn't say anything back.
      Kenchi made a good point.
      Insecters could have killed
      all of us back then, but
      they didn't. So it's not
      like they are raging gorillas
      or anything that will destroy
      anyone without reason. If
      they will attack, it has to
      be for a specific reason, but
      what?

      "Wait, does that mean the
      new homebase you chose was
      because of the protection
      insect-eaters give?"

      "Very perceptive, Rutger. Yes, it
      is one of the reasons. Without them,
      I will probably choose a different plan,
      like maybe just staying here."

      I was going to say, that won't
      guarantee that insecters won't
      attack us if we approach them.
      I was going to say that, but
      Kenchi may already have thought
      of that as well. I will just
      trust Kenchi's judgment on this one.

      We finally got to the castle entrance,
      and went inside to the throneroom,
      where once again Kenchi stood awkwardly
      on the stone chair.

      "We don't have much around here,
      but feel free to be at home, Rutger."

      "Okay, can I look around and see if I can
      find anything?"

      "You have my permission."

      ⁂

      I spent most of the afternoon
      going places, from room to room,
      searching every corner of the
      castle for something. Anything,
      books, journals, paintings, or
      maybe some magical ring that
      will give my unfair advantage
      for the rest of the conflicts
      I encounter. Heck, where's
      my time machine. Is it
      in the basement? No, there's
      nothing, not even a basement.

      In the end, I found nothing
      of interest. At most, all
      I found was weird looking
      tools that I have no idea
      how they are used. They
      are rusted too. I could
      do a more thorough check
      by looking for a secret
      entrace, but I wouldn't
      count on it. I'm getting
      tired, and Cat was getting
      bored. I appreciated her
      company, but I told her
      to hunt for food instead.
      She gladly obliged, and
      head out without delay.

      This castle is very unrpgish,
      at least let me open even a
      single treasure chest.
      I filed this complaint
      to the chicken standing
      awkwardly on the throne.

      "You find anything, Rutger?"

      "None. This place is a dump.
      I couldn't find a chest to open."

      "Cat wouldn't let you?"

      "Wouldn't let me what?"

      "Let you open her chest."

      You. What have this chicken
      been learning all this time.
      From the angle where I
      stand, it kind of looks like
      Kenchi is smirking at me,
      but bird don't have expressive
      facial structures, do they?
      Joke or not, I wouldn't be
      a man if I didn't want
      to open her precious chest.
      But that chest if locked,
      and I have to first defeat
      the big boss before I
      could even lay a single
      finger on it.

      Kenchi made chicken sounds.

      Laugh all you want, bastard,
      I spent the good of my life
      feasting on chicken breasts and thighs,
      and I bet you have none of it.
      You spent your youth in isolation,
      moaning about the unfairness of life,
      blaming everyone but your own.
      Your idea of socializing is
      passing time with your dearest human,
      like a certain loser with his loyal dog.
      Screw that, am I insulting Kenchi or myself?

      "What do you plan with Sofie?"

      "At dawn, she becomes one with the tree,
      the way she wished to.
      Will you attend her final departure?"

      "No... I mean, I will watch from distance."

      "Very well."

      I could ask what happened to her, but I respect
      their decision not to disclose the cause. If
      they don't tell, I won't ask. I could guess,
      yet I'd rather not think about it.

      I left the throneroom, then back on the room
      where the three of us stayed. Van wasn't
      still back, and Cat wasn't anywhere too.
      But I whiff a familiar scent, a predawn
      smoked meat in the air. I saw Cat outside
      the window, she was barbecuing these two little
      chicken-sized birds.

      I exited the room through the window, and
      joined Cat on the campfire.
      Cat was sitting on a moderately mossy log that
      has seen several fullmoons, and I sat at
      the other end of the log.

      "Tom, you don't suppose this is a dodaar, do you?"
      says Cat as she moved closer to me.

      I stared cluelessly at the lifeless skinned bird that
      burned slowly under a calm fire. It was too late,
      I could not recognize it anything but a delicious
      meal. All birds are chicken, if you put enough
      heat and seasoning on it. There's no use bemusing
      over trivialities. What's important is that we
      end the day with a satisfying meal, and leave
      our mundane problems for the next day.

      "No, can't be, it's too small and−"

      It could be a baby otherken, the voice in my
      head rebutted me.

      "and, and the beak's shape is different. Yeah,
      I'm sure that's just regular bird."

      Yep, a regular bird with no consciousness or
      soul that will haunt me from the coexistent dimension.

      "Thank goodness, I thought I killed our friends."

      Cat let out a sigh of relief and smiled.
      I don't think Kenchi would hold it against
      us though, accidents happen, Kentaro didn't
      mind getting an arrow to the head. As long
      as we don't habitually do the same mistakes,
      it won't bother them. Although, I guess
      we should say sorry at least, even if not
      for them, then at least for our own conscience.

      Speak of the chicken, I see Kentaro
      marching towards us from the distance.
      He was holding a basket in his beak again.
      It was as expected, filled with fruit varieties.
      Kentaro handed the basket to Cat, after which
      sat on the patch of dirt near me, but a bit
      further away from the fire.

      The three of us spent the campfired sunset,
      in the midst of an abandoned civilization
      where otherkens roam around busily, playing
      or just plain running around. I threw an apple
      to Kentaro, he catched it midair with its
      enormous beak, then crushed it effortlessly
      in a single bite. We dined together like
      real adventurers in a RPG game. Or isekai.

      The day ended without Van coming back.

      ⁂

      Early morning, I woke up to Cat's soft voice.
      I opened my eyes to see her standing on the
      bedside, looking at me.

      "The dodaars are moving, Tom."

      It took me a while to process what that meant.
      I'd get up now, but I have the hardest morning
      wood right now. It didn't do any help that
      I spent chopping it at least twice last night,
      so I could rest peacefully for the night.
      My eyes wandered and scanned Cat thoroughly
      as she was slightly bent over me.

      "You alright Tom?"

      "Yeah, j-just give me a minute."

      *redacted*

      I woke up in the middle night. I was
      having a dream, and I woke up right
      before the best part where I claim
      the holy grail. I felt all
      sticky underneath, I looked around
      to see a dark, barely lit room,
      with Cat on the other bed, sleeping
      peacefully on her side. I'll just
      wash myself tomorrow. I closed
      my eyes and fell asleep shortly
      afterwards.

      ⁂

      I woke up for real this time,
      early morning to a busy
      ambient noise. I could whiff
      the smell of burning coals,
      smoke coming through
      the window from the outside.
      I was alone in the room,
      but I could see Cat on the outside,
      like yesterday,
      attending to the meal we
      shall share together.

      Van was still not present
      anywhere. I could see
      Kentaro sitting on the
      mossy log beside Cat.

      I got up, but first I had
      to do was check up on Kenchi.
      He wasn't on the throneroom,
      nor anyone else. I checked
      the rooms one by one, until
      I got to Sofie's room, where
      Kenchi sat lonely on the
      stool. The bed was empty.

      "Good morning, Rutger."

      I looked at Walghvoghel.

      "I just finished breaktfast." says
      Kenchi as he jumped off the stool.

      "I wasn't ruminating, the concept
      of mourning is still foreign for me."

      I didn't say anything.

      "Though I could somehow understand
      Sofie now, how it feels to be left
      behind."

      I looked at the opened window, the
      translucent curtains hang still,
      the unoccupied bed,
      the empty stool,
      the undecorated walls,
      the life here was moved on,
      we shall too,
      to another place where we can
      look back and remember.

      Kenchi was already outside the room.

      "What's wrong Rutger? Cat ate your tongue?"

      Kenchi made chicken sounds.

      "Funny bird, it's cat got your tongue" I
      said. Although Cat eating my tongue has
      a tinge of eroticism in it. Maybe that
      was part of the joke? No, a talking
      chicken couldn't possibly know such
      things.

      "I'll begin gathering everyone. You
      stand by for the mean time, and get
      everything ready."

      Kenchi made chicken sounds as he
      headed outside the castle along
      with the two guarding otherkens.

      I head back into my room, and out
      of the window to rejoin with my
      party.

      I sat on the other end of the log,
      with Kentaro in the middle.

      "Here you go, Tom" Cat says as
      she handed me skewered slices
      of meat. I took a bite, it wasn't
      bird meat this time.

      "What's this?"

      "Possum"

      It wasn't bad. It was like pig meat,
      or a bit like goat. It could use
      some spices though. I ate the rest
      of it anyway without complaints.

      "How was it?"

      "It was fine, I like chicken better though."

      "Me too" she says as she ate her share.

      The three of us finished breakfast,
      sat idly while we wait.

      "Where's Van?"

      Cat shook her head and said
      "Nothing. He hasn't shown up
      since yesterday."

      "What do we do? Wait for him?" I asked.

      "He might be waiting at the river."

      Could be. I hope he's just waiting,
      and not waiting for action.

      Kentaro turned around and jumped
      off the log. He made chicken sounds
      in response to the chicken sounds
      that can be heard in the distance.

      "Mrove, weer shud goor"

      Cat and I stood up and followed
      Kentaro. I never left the sword
      on my side, this time I have
      the feeling I'll need it.

      ⁂

      We got to the town entrance,
      and the packs of otherken were
      already moving in formations of
      ten or more. Kenchi
      stood still as he watches
      his otherkens march ahead.

      "I was told that your friends
      are waiting by the waterfalls."
      says Kenchi.

      "What now? I have a bad feeling
      about this."

      "We proceed as planned, Rutger.
      I believe they are specifically
      waiting for you, not the griffeendts."

      How so? I guess it makes sense.
      If they really plan on joining,
      they would have been here already.

      "I think negotations have failed.
      Cat and I should avoid them,
      take another route, and meet up
      with you on the dark forest."

      "Do you have a special someone to return
      to, Rutger?"

      "Huh? What do you mean?"

      "Rutger, meeting with your friends
      would the best action to take right now."

      "What? I'm pretty sure they are planning
      on killing us."

      "Tom, what about Vanderbilt. He could
      be in trouble." Cat says.

      "Rest assured, Rutger. They won't kill
      you, at least not at this moment."

      Kentaro made chicken sounds.

      "I must go ahead now. Stay safe Rutger,
      Cat. Think twice before taking a step forward."

      Kenchi then marches on ahead.
      I've already thought about this more twenty times,
      and I still believe meeting with the "friends"
      is a bad idea. But I have to admit I feel
      like I missed to consider some things at hand.
      Kenchi has the broader picture of what's
      happening, I will just trust him.
      Kentaro is with us too, so it's not
      a definite losing situation.

      "Come on, Tom. Van is waiting."

      I nodded to Cat, and we marched on ahead.
      Kentaro was behind us, a bit further
      behind than usual. The marching otherkens
      walked fast, they were already way ahead.

      We took the usual route as before.
      When we finally got to the river,
      there was no one around, not even
      by the waterfalls. Kenchi and
      the otherkens have already entered
      the dark forest. It was quiet, aside
      from the flowing river.

      I looked up the tree tower and
      saw someone standing at the top.
      Is it Van? No, it looks more
      like Gregor.

      "Let's go up the tree tower" I said
      as we emerged out of the forest and
      into the river.

      Without time to react, people suddenly
      jumped out of nowhere and surrounded us.
      Swords pointed at our throats.

      "Welcome back, Tom"

      It was Gregor.

      "Come here, Kaatje."

      Cat hesitated for a bit, then
      walked to Gregors side.

      "I missed you, Kaat" Gregor said as
      he thrusted his tongue inside
      Cat's mouth, his one arm wrapped
      around her, and the other one
      held the sword that pointed at me.

      "What are you doing Gregor? I thought
      we would just talk this through."
      Van says as moved closer to us.

      Gregor released Cat from his sticky
      fingers. Cat fell on the ground,
      sitting awkwardly, avoiding eye
      contact with me.

      "Just playing it safe, Van. Standard
      procedures. Tom made contact with the
      enemies. We need to make sure he's
      not hostile."

      "Tom, the boss wants to see you." Gregor
      says as he gestured up to the tree tower.
      The men holding the swords sheated
      their swords in unison and made way
      for me. The look nothing like hunters,
      or pirates.

      "Boss? You mean Dirk?"

      "Go, don't make the big guy waiting.
      Don't do anything reckless."

      I started walking slowly. Where's
      Kentaro? I was afraid to turn around
      and look, so I just kept on walking
      while I stared at Cat. She just
      sat there, staring at nothing.

      I climbed the tree without delay,
      expecting for the worst.

      ⁂

      I steadily climbed up the tree,
      taking the time to plan ahead
      what I could do to get out of this
      situation. If the boss is alone up
      there, then they underestimate me too much.
      I could take him out if things
      get unfavorable. Not kill him though,
      just deliver a hit that will
      put us in the advantage.

      When I finally reached the top,
      a large man perched casually
      at the thicker branches. It
      wasn't Dirk. A dangerous
      looking woman stood at the other
      end of the corner, watching
      my every move.

      The boss was about as tall
      as Gregor, maybe slightly shorter.
      Similar to Gregor,
      the boss has a commanding presence,
      he wore a clean and kempt uniform,
      but has the demeanor of a gang member.

      He stood away from the branches
      and walked closer to me.

      "What's wrong Rutger? You
      forgot how to pay respect
      to your superiors?"

      What do I do, salute? I
      feel like if I make the
      wrong move, I will lose
      an arm, for the very least.

      "No matter" boss says as
      he walked back.

      "You are ordered to act
      like a hunter, and be one
      of the hunters after all."

      In the this restricted space,
      he started pacing back and forth.

      "You are doing well, maybe too
      well. Act like the hunter, but
      I believe you are forgetting
      your part."

      I didn't say anything. I can't
      say anything, can I? I don't
      remember anything. I only
      guess things so far.

      "Tell me, Rutger. Have you
      forgotten? Have you lost track
      of why you are here?"

      "N-no sir."

      "Good. That's good. Because
      your wife and son won't be
      very happy if you do."

      He stopped walking.

      "Your family is in good health.
      They have everything they need,
      good food, a mansion, education,
      and every pleasures imaginable."

      "And all of that can go away in
      an instant. In the blink of an
      eye, everything would be gone.
      No, they won't even have the streets
      to sleep on. They will spend
      of what's remaining in their body
      and mind in the deepest part of the
      dungeon. They wouldn't even able
      to take their own life, if they
      wanted, their freedom are chained
      and locked away. Their spirit and
      mind will disintegrate to pieces, long
      before their hearts stop beating."

      "All because you got carried away
      playing your hunter games with
      your little birdies."

      Fuck. I knew there was something wrong.
      I thought it was strange Rutger
      will be here. There was a catch,
      a big one.
      Why didn't I think of
      this before? I had no choice all along,
      it was a checkmate right at the beginning.

      "Well, Rutger? Or are you okay with that?
      Because you find another woman to play with?"

      "No sir. No sir, I have not forgotten.
      Everything is going with the plan."

      "Oho? How so? Tell me, Rutger how
      is joining the fat arse
      birds part of the plan?
      Because to me, it sounds like
      you are staging a rebellion."

      "Sofie is already dead. I just
      need to gain Walghvoghel's full
      trust, and gather them all in
      one place. Walghvoghel trusts
      me like how he trusts Sofie.
      I'm just setting up the
      big stage for the final act."

      Bossman roared a laughter.

      "Clever scheming bastard.
      You son of a bitch. You
      devil incarnate."

      Bossman pats me on the shoulder.

      "Good to hear, Rutger. I expect
      good news from you. Don't worry,
      once this is all over, you will be back
      with your family, and not have
      to worry about money and food
      forever."

      "Yes sir"

      With one final pat, boss
      gestured to the dangerous
      looking woman.

      "Come Nelleke, we're leaving"

      I moved out of the way as they descend
      the ladder. The boss went down
      first as the Nelleke watches
      over me.

      We both stared at each other
      in the eyes. She was actually
      kind of gorgeous. Not as
      gorgeous as Cat, but definitely
      a looker as well.

      I step away further because
      it seems she was too cautious
      of me. She then proceeded
      to go down.

      ⁂

      I watched them both reach
      the river grounds. I see
      the boss talk to Gregor,
      then he left with
      the other men who appears
      to be actually soldiers.
      They didn't head into
      the dark forest though.
      They walked on ahead,
      following the river flow.

      It was just Cat, Van and
      Gregor that was left. I then see
      them climbing up the tree tower.

      I sat down on the corner.
      Truth be told, I don't know
      anything about my wife
      or son. I don't remember
      them, I don't feel
      anything particular for them,
      except as a fellow human being.
      They will be just among
      the casualities of this war.
      I feel bad for everyone
      involved, but no special
      feelings for my supposed
      son and wife. Who's to
      say that they are not
      already dead?

      This is after all, a
      clean and sweep operation.
      Leave no memories behind.
      Only very few will get
      to live, the rest who
      knows about this will
      disappear one way or another.
      Since they already suspected
      me of betrayal, they likely
      have already taken precautionary
      steps. They will kill
      my supposed Wife and son
      regardless,
      so they might as well do
      now or later.

      The talk we just had now
      was just a psychological
      attack, in an attempt to
      control me back, or turn me
      into a weakness of the opposing side
      that can be exploited later on.
      They have already planned other
      means of ensuring success.
      I'm just a mere time bomb
      that they hope to at least
      incur some damage on the
      opportune moments.

      But that's where got it
      wrong. I'm not Rutger of
      the military pigs. I am
      Thomas of lower class.
      It won't deter me, the opposite
      in fact. I'm now only more
      determined to destroy, now
      that I now I'm fighting against
      the actual hellspawns.

      I have
      no way of saving my
      would-be family, unless
      I defeat the whole dutch army.
      In conclusion, my plan
      doesn't change on bit.
      I will continue to side with
      the Kenchi and otherkens,
      and protect Cat with my life.
      It would be nice if in the
      aftermath my family would be saved,
      but that is not my goal.

      The only problem for now
      is Gregor.

      ⁂

      I tried looking for Kentaro,
      but I wasn't able to find
      him from this height. But
      I'm sure he's safe, and just
      lurking out behind the trees.
      The boss never knew his existence.

      Cat got to the top first,
      I managed to get a quick peek
      of the holy grail as she climbed
      up. She didn't look at me though,
      it's like I didn't even exist.
      She stood on the other side of the
      corner, and looked out on the river.

      Van and Gregor followed shortly after
      her. The hunter party is once again
      complete. I wasn't really in the mood
      for celebratory music in my head.
      Not especially with Gregfuck in here.

      "Hey, Tom" says Van. He threw his bag
      beside me. I got up though, and
      stood near Cat.

      "Now we are all here again, let's
      begin with the briefing. But first
      things first"

      Gregor cut off his words and faced me.

      "I'm sorry for doubting you Tom. I really
      thought you sided with the enemies.
      I'm sorry."

      That was really unexpected. Never
      in this lifetime I thought I would
      hear those kind of words from Gregor.
      Maybe I misjudged his character?

      "No, it's nothing. No need for
      apologies."

      "No, but we should. You acted on your own,
      and after Van told me everything, I was
      sure you betrayed us."

      "But the Boss told us just now the real
      reason. The dodaars got your beloved family,
      your wife and only son. The evil dodaars
      held them captive, they will be killed
      unless you join their side." explained
      Gregor.

      "Yeah, Tom, you should've just told us.
      We could have worked together and plan
      something. Greg here always comes up
      with a plan. We're in this together.
      Right?" says Van.

      What just happened. Just like that,
      the tables have turned.

      "No, I mean"

      I hesitated. Telling them outright
      that it's lie seems like an obvious
      thing to do, but is it really?

      "It's alright Tom. You can trust us"
      Van added.

      Cat walked away from me, and hugged
      Gregor tightly. She finally looked at
      me, but with the eyes of the hunter.

      "Why didn't you tell us you had a family,
      Tom? All this time you had a wife and yet−" Cat
      says with a coarse voice.

      "Come on, Kaatje, don't be too hard on Tom.
      He's the victim here." says Van.

      "No, it's not, I mean" I struggled to
      say what I'm thinking.

      My vision blurred, my eyes felt like it
      was bleeding, I wiped it off, it was
      just water.

      Gregor moved forward, and pat me
      on the shoulders.

      "Don't hold it back Tom. Real men
      don't hide their tears."

      This is the worst. My face feels hot,
      I have snot that keeps dripping out out
      my nose, and my eyes just transformed
      into a goddamn waterfall. I don't want
      to be seen like this. I rushed down
      the ladders and fleed away from the scene.

      "Where are you going Tom?" asked Van.

      None of your business, Vandodoor.
      I dipped my face in the river water.
      Are you stupid?
      Why are you getting emotional?
      Seriously, relax.

      I dipped and washed my face several times,
      until my eyes sored. My snot stopped
      dripping now.

      I sat on the river side, looking at
      the forest where Kentaro might be hiding.
      The boss got me real good. He's cunning,
      I underestimated him, he striked
      me right at my weakest point.
      I can't tell them that it's a lie,
      because it's not a totally lie. It's the
      half-truth, and that makes it harder
      to call it a mere lie. And it doesn't
      matter if it's half-true or half-lie,
      it doesn't matter who said it.
      The smallest lie would breed into
      an eventual distrust and more lies.

      Given the choice, Gregor would definitely
      belive the boss more. Van already
      suspected me once, and would only
      distrust me more if I call the Boss
      a liar. And for Cat... I'm not
      sure why, but Cat clearly hates me now.
      The contorted contempt I saw on her face,
      it was the first time in my life I
      saw someone show that face to me.
      It was seething with hate, it was
      telling me to go away and die.
      Did the boss told her another lie?

      I stood up and watched the eternal
      rival flow. With one wrong move,
      I could lose all my friends.
      It's not clear if there's a winning move,
      but calling the Boss a liar
      would be the final losing move.

      I have to just go with the lies for now.
      The otherkens took my family as
      a hostage, and forced me to join their side.
      Then what? I could somehow tell
      what's Gregor is planning already.

      I should go up there and stop
      him before he makes up his mind.

      I look up, I see them descending the ladders.

      ⁂

      "So what's the plan Tom?"

      "Huh? What do you mean?"

      "Boss said you already have the plans,
      he said we should just follow your orders
      and support you."

      "Wait, does that mean I'm the leader now?
      Are you guys okay with that?"

      Gregor shrugged and said "Yeah, you
      could say that. But only for the main
      mission. I still call the shots for
      the other things."

      Okay, I'm not sure if being the leader
      is a good thing. Do I even have a plan?
      What were we planning to do in the first place.

      Then I remembered about the insect-eaters.

      "Alright then. Our first mission then is
      to head into the dark forest."

      "What!? We'll die."

      "No, we will not. Trust me." I said
      with confidence. If I'm going to
      play with the lie, then I might
      as well fake my confidence.

      I made chicken sounds.

      Kentaro comes running out of the forest.

      Heh, it actually worked. I heard Kenchi
      make that sound several times before.
      I didn't think he would actually understand it.

      Gregor took Van's sword, and unsheated it.

      "Stay back" Gregor went into defensive position,
      and made several warning jabs at Kentaro.

      I held my hands up to Gregor.

      "Wait, he's with us." I said as I
      pet Kentaro's head.

      Kentaro made chicken sounds.

      "Seriously now?"

      "Yes, seriously. He's part of the
      next plan. With him, we can safely
      cross the dark forest."

      "Wait" says Van, a bit confused.
      "This is the first time I'm hearing this.
      What exactly are you planning, Tom?"

      "Don't worry about it. Let's go"

      What am I planning exactly again?
      I don't know, I just want to see
      the insect-eaters. It probably
      won't help us, but I don't care.
      I need to sort my mind out,
      seeing some exotic monkeys is
      a nice diversion.

      Kentaro, lead the way.

      ⁂

      I pat Kentaro's, and he made chicken sounds.
      Kenchi should have told him what we
      are here for. Kentaro understood,
      and started walking into the dark forest.

      "Come on"

      "Are you sure about this?"

      "The king dodaars told me, insect-eaters
      won't attack us"

      "Insect-what?"

      "I will explain while we walk, just
      come one"

      They finally give in and followed
      inside the dark forest. Even during
      day time, it quickly got dark after
      a few steps in.

      "Van, light the torch."

      "Tom, are you sure you are not
      just trying to get us killed."

      I might as well be. Look at Cat
      holding hands together. Not with
      me though, she held hands with Gregor.
      And not just some babysit hand-holding
      too, I mean the passionate criss-cross
      hand-holding. What sweet a couple
      they make. A romantic date, right
      in this shithole. We might as well
      all be killed, I'd go straight
      to hell, Cat and Gregor are already
      in heaven anyway.

      "Yes, please. No, I meant, it's
      fine."

      I explained everything as we walked.
      It was for the most part just a theory
      though. We will test that theory
      with our own life. This is what it means
      to be an adventurer.

      We walk and walked. It wasn't tiring
      or anything, we just walked at regular
      pace, not in any rush. For me, it
      was cathartic. I held the torch
      and stayed close to Kentaro. Van
      was behind me, and the lovely couple
      behind him.

      I underestimated the scale of this forest.
      We've been walking for God knows how long.
      It's been an hour at least. Or five times
      that. I lost track of the time.

      "How long are we going to keep walking?" Van finally asked

      I pat Kentaro on the back.

      "Break, we stop" I said to Kentaro

      "Furrow" said Kentaro, after which
      he made a slight detour. We followed
      him to an spacious area that was
      suitable for camping.

      Kentaro stopped and made chicken sounds.

      "Okay, we camp here."

      As usual, Cat was in charge of the camp
      fire. She picked a bunch of sticks and
      twigs and started a fire without much effort.
      There were lots of dry leaves on the ground too.
      Van scouted the surrounding area, checking the
      all the corners, and climbing the trees.

      Gregor just sat down, clearly winded from
      walking. I sat down too, but away from him
      and Cat. My legs felt really heavy right
      after sitting.

      "Well, it looks like you are right, Tom.
      No one attacked us" says Gregor.

      "Yeah" I don't know if I was glad or disappointed.

      Van got back and brought some weird looking fruits.

      "What's that?" I asked.

      "I dunno, but it tastes great."

      Wha? Whatever, what doesn't kill makes
      me stronger, as the saying goes. I took
      a bite out of the maybe deadly fruit,
      and it was delicious, for the lack of better
      word.

      "This is great, Van. Get some more"

      "You got it Boss" and off he go.

      You hear that Gregoogoor? I'm giving
      orders now. Quick, go fuck yourself.
      Just kidding, I can't hate Gregor now
      as much I used to. I hate myself more
      than anything. Why did Cat suddenly
      acted real cold towards me though.

      Van got back with a bagful of these
      weird fruits. We ate and had a good
      time. I probably ate most of the fruit.
      If the weird fruit turned out bad,
      I'd be the first one to go.

      It wasn't really a campfire without
      stories. Van did much of the talking,
      he told stories about their hunts in
      the old days.
      Gregor occasionally lauged while
      he hugged Cat close. I tried to listen,
      but my mind wasn't really paying attention.
      I savored the atmosphere, and listened
      closely for possible incoming monkeys.

      One thing I felt after eating the fruit
      was that I felt really relaxed and sleepy.
      Perhaps the fruit had natural sedatives
      in it. I temporarily rested my back on
      the pile of dried leaves, I fell into
      a deep sleep not a minute after.
