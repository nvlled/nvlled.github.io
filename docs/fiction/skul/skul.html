        you finally reached the school.
        Frosty, the snowman watchman, keeps
        on guard against delinquent students who
        disobey rules. The school is very strict
        about wearing proper attire and a kindred soul.

        "Hey, you punk, where's your soul?" says frosty.

        Crap. You forgot to bring your soul with you.

        "I forgot..."

        "NO SOUL, NO ENTRY!"

        "B-but that guy there doesn't have one too!"

        "No excuses! NO SOUL, NO ENTRY!"

        What a frozen popsicle, you muttered to your soul-less
        self. You have no choice but to <a href="reskul.html">go back to your home</a></> and re-possess yourself with a soul. </pre></body></html>
