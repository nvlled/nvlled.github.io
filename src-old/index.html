    Greetings. This is an eternally work-in-progress
    personal site. I'm not sure what I should
    put here, but I guess a <a href='{{urlfor "blog"}}'>blog</a> would do,
    as well as some <a href='{{urlfor "mysides"}}'>javascript games and utilities.</a>
</p>
{{template "mainnav" .}}
<style>
img#thingy {
    display: inline-block;
    float: right;
    width: 200px;
    margin: 5px;
}
</style>

</div>
