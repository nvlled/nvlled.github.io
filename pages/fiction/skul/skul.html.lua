        After an eternity of infernal marching
        you finally reached the school.
        Frosty, the snowman watchman, keeps
        on guard against delinquent students who
        disobey rules. The school is very strict
        about wearing proper attire and a kindred soul.

        "Hey, you punk, where's your soul?" says frosty.

        Crap. You forgot to bring your soul with you.

        "I forgot..."

        "NO SOUL, NO ENTRY!"

        "B-but that guy there doesn't have one too!"

        "No excuses! NO SOUL, NO ENTRY!"

        What a frozen popsicle, you muttered to your soul-less
        self. You have no choice but to ]] / A { href = "reskul.html", "go back to your home" } / BR /
    [[ and re-possess yourself with a soul. ]]
