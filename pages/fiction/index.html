        All of them are unfinished, and I doubt
        I would ever find the time or energy to finish
        them, or even just edit them.
    </p><p>I don't think these works of junks have anyliterary value even in the most generous sense.But I think they are at least amusing to read,in more ways than one.</p><p>        If you have questions, or anything to comment about,
