    This time, I have actively resisted to spend any time resource on
    non-functional aspects like design. I thought of purposely making it as
    hideous as possible, but I reconsidered since that might actually degrade
    useability.

    in mind. My motivation to work on past projects was affected by the
    realization that I can't create good-looking, well-designed software. I
    thought, no way people would even think about trying what I made, seeing how

    If the Craiglist Test holds water, then it doesn't matter how shitty it
    looks in the beginning, the important part is core functions it provides.
    I'm getting ahead of myself though. Would it be useful? For me, first and
    foremost? Will it provide value that some people would consider paying for
    it? Who knows. Maybe not.

    But yeah, I'll hold any further development for now, and just use it as part
    of my daily routine. In the meanwhile, I'll start on the next project idea.
