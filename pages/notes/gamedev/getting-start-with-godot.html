    documentation, from <i>Introduction</i> to the <i>Your first 2D Game</i>.
    Before proceeding to the 3D tutorial, I thought I should try to at least make a
    simple 2D game based on what I just learned, to help reinforce how to work
    wth the Godot engine.</p><p>    I'm a little torn which main scripting language I should use for Godot,
    GDScript or C#. I definitely prefer non-whitespace sensitive statically
    typed languages, but GDscript has better integration with the Godot
    editor, and some code are more concise with GDScript.</p><p>    While doing the tutorial, I started with GDscript, then converted each
    script to C#. It was a pretty straightforward translation. The parts that
    stumped me a bit was getting the nodes and the signals.
  </p><h1>Node retrieval</h1><p>    In GDscript, getting nodes is short and easy: $NodeName.DoSomething()</p><p>    But with C#, I would do something like:</p><p>    <code> GetNode&lt;NodeType&gt;("NodeName").DoSomething(). </code></p><p>    On the plus side, it's
    more type-safe, but admit it's a but verbose. It's not a deal breaker
    though, just a tiny minor inconvenience.
  </p><h1>Signals</h1><p>    In Godot, events are called signals, and the act of listening to these
    signals is called connecting. That's how I understand it anyways, maybe
    there's a reason they opted to use a different terminology for it.
    Admittedly, <b>connecting a signal</b> is quite a deviation from the usual
    programming nomenclature that it does throw me off a bit, I have to do a
    double take to confirm I understood what it means.</p><p>    There are two ways to connect a signal, one by using the editor, and the
    other by code.</p><p>    <img src="/notes/images/note-2.png"/>
    In the image above, to connect a function to a signal, I just click any of
    the lines that has a red icon in it. For instance, I double-click
    <b>timeout </b>and a new window pops up.</p><p>    <img src="/notes/images/note-1.png"/>
    With GDscript, after clicking the connect button, it shows the script
    file, and creates the function <b>on_message_timer_timeout</b> for me:</p><p>    <img src="/notes/images/note-3.png"/>
    With C#, after clicking the connect button, nothing happens. Even if I
    manually create the method <b>on_message_timer_timeout</b>, it still failed to
    connect. Not sure if this is a bug, or I failed to read a footnote and did
    something wrong. It doesn't matter though, because I don't prefer this way
    of connecting to signals.</p><p>    The code way of connecting to signals works just fine.</p><p>    <img src="/notes/images/note-4.png"/>
    <img src="/notes/images/note-5.png"/>
    Here, the signals are BodyEntered, Timeout, and Pressed. The <b>+=</b> are
    the what connects the signals to the corresponding methods/functions. For
    me, the code way of connecting signals is better, even if it's more
    verbose. When I converted GDScript to C#, one pain point was the runtime
    errors related to missing connected signal functions.</p><p>    After all that writing, I actually convinced myself that I would just use
    C# for the main scripting language. That all said, I'm going to think or
    decide what simple game to make while I lie down on the floor, and maybe
    take a nap while I'm at it.</p><p>    Also, I'm using screenshots of code because I haven't setup a syntax highlighter yet </p></body></html>
