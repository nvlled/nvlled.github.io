    While lazily procrastinating on my desk, I noticed a weaver ant crawling
    on my desk. It wasn't that all unsual to have big ants crawling around me,
    since they have a large colony atop the mango tree not too far from my
    desk. I don't really mind them, as they don't bite or anything since
    they're worker ants. For weaver ants anyway, other smaller ants
    indiscriminately bite anything.

    Sometimes a lost one would crawl on my arm, and I would just pinch-flick
    them away.

    Anyway, as I said, I recently noticed an ant crawling on my desk. I almost
    pinch-flick it, except I noticed it moved kind of weird: way faster and
    alert than the usual ants I see.

    I took a closer look, and noticed it's appearance is also kind of strange.
    The ass, or should I say, the abdomen has a lighter yellowish color, and
    it's head had these weird black circles on it.

    What's that, a fungi-infested zombie ant?

    When I tried to poke it with a pen, it then jumped and landed on the pen,
    to my surprise.

    Do ants even jump?

    Heck no, I spent way too much around these bitey-crawleys to know how they
    move. They can't jump, or don't know how to jump? If they do need to get
    across a gap, they'll make a bridge out of their bodies.

    Then I remember reading or watching about spiders that pretend to be ants.
    Observing it a bit more, I realize that it does indeed move like one of
    those smaller jumping spiders. Looking it up, these spiders are called
    myrmarachne, myrm for ant, and arachne for spider.

    I captured the little pretender, and put it on a plastic bottle with holes
    on it. I was curious how it will behave near other spiders, so I put one
    small jumping spider into the bottle, along with a cellar spider. To
    complete the weird mix, I added two really tiny cockroaches too.

    And... nothing's happening. I left it overnight, and still nothing
    happened. Except for the cellar spider than spun a web on middle of the
    bottle, everyone else kept their distance and respected each other's
    company. The two cockroaches were cuddling next to each other. And they
    were all alive, no predation happened.

    Surely the other two jumping spiders are capable enough to take each other
    down and the two roaches. But I guess it's either they are not hungry, or
    they conform to a strict dietary plan. I guess it's like putting a
    raccoon, a beaver, a capybara and a marmot into a single cage and
    expecting them to have a tournament.

    Anyways, it doesn't like they will do anything so I left the bottle open
    and let them free.

    There's one thing I was wondering about though. Why does myrmarachne have
    to perfectly mimic the visual appearance of an ant? It's not like ants
    have eyes that are capable of seeing those finer complex visual details of
    an ant. They use their antennas to communicate and navigate, I think?

    So my guess is that myrmarache visual copy is not to trick the ants
    themselves, but to trick the surrounding observers, specifically the
    predators. That explains the protective mimicry, where myrmarache blends
    in with the ants for their own protection.

    But what about aggressive mimicry, where they mimic appearance to lure
    models (the ants) to improve chances of predation. It doesn't seem to make
    much sense for myrmarachne though. Ants probably can't tell the visual
    difference anyway, so looking like them doesn't do shit.

    Well, I don't really have an answer. I guess myrmarachne solely does
    protective mimicry only. I'm not entirely convinced by my own
    half-explanations. What I do find more interesting is that nature is
    capable of doing mimicry for bizarre reasons. It's the closest thing we
    have to shape-shifting.

    And then I get a frightening thought: what if there are creatures
    aggressively mimicking as humans? If such creatures with perfect mimicry
    exist, then we will never be able to tell apart the fake humans with just
    our own senses from the outside. They could just be fellow humans as far
    as we can tell, except they feed on us, one by one, from the darkness
    where our screams echoes hopelessly into the void.

    That can't be possible right? But if nature is crazy enough to make
    myrmarachne, what's stopping it from creating bizzare creatures that mimic
    humans? With recent advances in AI, it's actually entirely possible to
    mimic human aspects like sound or speech without fully mimicking a human
    brain.

    A mimic's though process would go like: "Aha that stinky human is making
    that sound, I should make this sound. Stinky human is making movement
    pattern 1, I should respond with this sound and this movement. EKEKEKEK.
    That blood vessel suure looks yumyum." Of course, it's incapable of such
    devious thought, it would merely be enacting it's natural instict.

    But if such things exist, surely people have at least killed, disected or
    performed surgery on at least one of these hypothetical mimics, thereby
    revealing their strange inhuman anatomical structure? Maybe because their
    numbers are really rare, like a 1:1000000 ratio, similar to one
    myrmarachne preying per one million ants. Maybe they were already part of
    some medical history, but their records are declared as mere rare
    abnomalities, like birth defects and or strange cellular mutations. Or,
    these creatures are precisely careful enough to rarely get caught in the
    first place. If they were ever caught in the past, their existence would
    be mistakenly labeled as fictional in the books.

    How would they hunt though? It makes sense they would go after the weaker
    ones, or the solitary ones. Or if neither is available, they would resort
    to luring the prey away from the crowd. Unlike insects and animals, humans
    uses tools and weapons. Even it's 10x stronger than a human, it would not
    engage in a direct front attack, much like how most bears instinctively
    just avoid humans. So I guess human mimics, as with most predators, would
    resort to stealth, and would attack humans when they at their most
    vulnerable state.

    What about feeding? Maybe they are like vampires, they just drink blood
    and just make it look like the victims are anemic when the bodies are
    found. Autopsy wouldn't reveal anything out of the ordinary that way
    except for some bite marks or stab wounds. Or maybe they devour
    everything, and wouldn't leave a single cell behind. The victim would
    forever vanish like a regular missing person case.

    Okay, this is actually creepy. I might actually convince myself that these
    human mimics are real. Or not. Even if they are real, they are not really
    that much worse from psychotic serial killers, which arguably are worse
    than mimics. It's an interesting though experiment nonetheless. Hopefully
    there isn't one in the neighbourhood, if ever. Maybe I should check for
    cases of local missing persons just in case...

    Just kidding. Wait, what if I'm one those mimics!?
