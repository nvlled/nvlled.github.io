    H1 "Next Dumb Idea: A monologue note-taking app",
    PP [[
      Now I'm in the testing phase of Catchsup, I am now going to explore and
      convince myself that the next project I'm going to work on isn't equally
      dumb.

      In a nutshell, the app will be a yet another note-taking tool, but, it
      will be like an offline chat, where the user shall speaking in vain to his
      own lonesome company. In other words, note-taking by means of monologue.
      But I could already do that with a plain text editor, so to to get in
      character and mindset of actually speaking to someone, there will be an
      persona/avatar whom the user will be directing their thoughts.

      Of course, since I'm strictly adhering to ludditech (luddite tech), I will
      avoid using any fancy AI shit. What a waste of space, a person of the
      future would say, but making the app dependency-free, especially from
      third-party companies, is a selling point. If AI/LLM has advanced to the
      point they could be entirely deployed and ran efficiently on a consumer
      device without burning a lot of resource, then I'm all for it. But as of
      now, the costs far outweigh the benefits.

      Besides, a persona responding with intelligible words defeats the whole
      point of a monologue. I specifically chose this dumb idea because Of the
      appealing simplicity of idea that I could try implementing in a week or
      two.

      Sure it does, for me at least. When I write, sometimes I address the
      hypothetical readers directly in second-person point of view (that reader
      could even be myself). A monologue is just a personification of that
      hypothetical reader. Instead of an abstract audience, I have a refified
      listener that I could speak on a more personal level. Is it any better
      than regular note-taking though? Maybe not, but it sure is less lonely(?)

      <h1>How would the persona would be like?</h1>A persona that is just a
      static image would be almost too useless, so there needs to have some kind
      of interactivity or feedback. What kind of interactivity? As I said, it
      can't respond with intelligible words. But what if it utters its own
      language, say like a pokemon, when it responds back? For instance, I start
      the conversation with a fake-pikachu, it would respond with something like
      "pika~~", both in text and sound effect, and jiggle-animate the avatar as
      a bonus. God knows what fake-pikachu actually meant by that, but the best
      part is that it's open to interpretation. I can fill in the meaning based
      on what I'm feeling and what I have in mind. It engages my imagination and
      keep the monologue going.

      Sounds good in theory, but would that even work in practice? Who knows,
      only way to find out is to try it.

      Probably. The downside is that the note-taking app market definitely is
      saturated with clones that has little to no variation. On the bright side,
      the note-taking market is large and already established. If I could even
      get a tiny share of that market, I could get non-trivial returns.

      Indeed, a monologue isn't something that everyone is comfortable of doing,
      so I'm already targeting a relative niche, maybe for writers primarily.
      Then again, isn't note-taking already targeted primarily to writers?

      Jokes aside, this is an interesting point. I do wonder how would the hype
      around LLM would affect the note-taking market. Will it kill off a
      subtantial segment of the market? Or will it be largely be remained
      unaffected?

      Here what I think: people who think LLM will deprecate writing and
      note-taking are the same set of people who doesn't take notes or doesn't
      like writing to begin with. The kind of people who sees writing as a
      chore, or as mere means to and end. I am going to avoid further commenting
      with regards to LLM, since the debates and arguments around this topic are
      poorly thought-out or politically/emotionally driven. In an ideal world,
      AIs and LLMs will be used for entertainment or as a productivity force
      multipler, but I feel like in reality, it will be used (or marketed) for
      entirely different purposes.

      For the UI design, I think I'll just copy the regular messaging app
      design. Show the profile pic at the top, and the messages interleaved on
      both alternating sides.

      I'm still deciding whether to allow group chats and whether that makes
      sense for a monologue-ing. This is important to consider since it
      completely affects how I would actually represent the state. Well, to keep
      things simple for now, no group chats. I don't see a use case for this
      just yet anyway.

      Do I allow creating custom topics or conversation, or just use the
      different personas for organizing a topic? For instance, I'll talk to
      pikachu about the general day to day activities. Then for one project, I
      talk to piccolo about my recent issues and roadblocks. In another project,
      I'll have a conversation with yoshi. Then create a search UI if ever I
      need a recap on something? Yeah, this would work.

      I could use actual people personas, and just use a language I'm not
      familiar with. That shouldn't break the immersion as long as the user
      doesn't actually translate what the foreign persona is saying. Maybe I'm
      talking about the weather, and the foreign person is at the same time
      talking about, uh, how cows are actually cryptids to places that doesn't
      have cows.

      I forgot the term where japanese people occasionally respond with "humu
      humu", or "sou desu ne" to show attentiveness when listening. I think
      concept is very similar to what I'm planning with the personas. Okay,
      maybe not. Would it make sense if I ask something like "Is it possible to
      utilize senses of animals to have a different perspective on empericism?"
      and the person reponds with humu humu. It sort of makes since if I
      consider my questions purely rhetorical. Maybe scientists could hook a
      mantis shrimp to a machine and ... No, this wouldn't work. If I said
      hello, and the person just responds back with yet again with humuhumu,
      what then. In conclusion, this way of showing attentiveness wouldn't work
      here? Where did I hear humu humu again, aside from Ina? Is that an actual
      response japanese make? I think I heard it from an anime called trigger
      something something.

      All in all, the core feature for now should be simple, literally just a
      chat app without a network connection. I should avoid implementing
      anything else and test it as soon as possible, since I still doubts have
      whether this is a viable product.

      With that all set in place, I ask myself once again, do I still think it's
      a dumb idea? I was expecting to drop the idea, as I spent a day or two
      staring at my notebook, and I just couldn't see the idea any other way
      besides being dumb.

    Yet I managed to bring good points in favor of the idea. I guess I'm
    proceeding with the development after all...
