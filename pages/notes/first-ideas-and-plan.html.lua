    Ah, once again, time flew faster than a fruit fly on a banana held by a
    mountain gorilla swinging on a vine. I should check my auto-screenshot
    logs to see what I did these past few weeks because I certainly have no
    recollection of doing anything notable.

    I mean, I know I've been doing "data gathering", which is for the most
    part just endlessly scrolling HN/reddit/mastodon and youtube. I didn't
    think two weeks have already passed.

    Oh wait, there is someting notable. I started reading a book called "The
    Right It". I also started reading another book called "The Future is
    Degrowth". It was a book I found while mindlessly scrolling mastodon
    instances. I still haven't fully internalized the book, but it's one of
    those books that speaks to my soul.

    It's amusing though to simultaneously read two books that are seemlingly
    opposed to one another, one book that details how to make use of the
    capitalist system, and the other that calls to question the mistaken
    capitalist idea that growth and progress is always good and can be scaled
    infinitely without consequences.

    I set aside my thoughts and reflections on those books for now since I'm
    here to explore my ideas and plans to execute them.

    While "data gathering", I have managed to accumulate four to five pages of
    mostly useless ideas on my physical notebook. It doesn't matter if it
    seems dumb, stupid or impractical, I just note it down anyway. Sometimes,
    a dumb idea combined with another dumb idea produces another idea that
    seems like a good idea.

    I should note that forcing myself to think of ideas for an extended period
    of time is actually stressful, and most often than not, results in
    short-sighted or uncreative output. Ideas come when I'm doing something
    else, or when I'm not actively thinking about it. I just think hard about
    it for a moment, then come back to it later, and see if I have better
    insights. It remains to be seen though if this creative process is
    actually effective at yielding good ideas since I have yet implemented any
    of them.

    But okay, I have now shitty ideas, now I just have to filter and sort them
    according the ease of implementation. For now, I have three plausible
    ideas that can done with zero capital.

    If there's one thing I've learned from those entrepreneurship books, it's
    that I should make sure I have a market demand, and that I'm building the
    "Right It" before investing large resources into it. I should use reliable
    strategies and objective metrics to know if I have potential market
    demand.

    In my case though, the only resource I have is time and energy. And since
    I'm only going to implement ideas that doesn't require that much time and
    energy, I don't have much to lose if I just skip pre-market validation and
    jump right straight to implementation. This is an insight that I got from
    tinyprojects.dev. The initial implementation is the market validation.

    Of course, the ideas from the books will be applicable for more, bigger
    ambitious projects that require more investment. At the moment, I'm
    neither ambitious nor have resources to go for the bigger things.

    One of the requirement I set for myself is that the product must be useful
    or solves a problem. How would I know that if I don't do any validation?
    Simple, my algorithm would be as follows:
      ]],
  OL {
    LI "Create MVP or prototype",
    LI [[
        Use it myself. If I don't find it useful myself or don't want to use
        it to save my life, then it's a flop. Move on to the next idea.{" "}
    ]],
    LI [[
        Share to few people. If it's useful for me, then maybe it's useful for
        others as well. I reach out to one or more people who would
        potentially find it useful. If I don't receive a good feedback, then
        I'll stop working on it, but I still keep using it anyway, and add to
        my project list.
    ]],
    LI [[
          Improve product. If I receive good feedback, then I would start
          putting more resources into it (time, money, effort) for production
          use.
    ]]
  },

    This seems like a reasonable plan to follow through.

    But what about the part where I should make sure that people will pay for
    it? Well, if people find it useful and wants to use it, then they will pay
    for it, either directly with money, or indirectly through word of mouth.
    So the problem is more contingent on the utility of the product, and the
    number of people who knows about it.

    The less actual value a product has, the more need for forced marketing.
    The more actual value, the less need for forced marketing. Conversely, the
    more deceptively good marketing is done, the more perceived (not actual)
    value is created.

    Is this true? I'd like to believe this is true. I'm ideologically opposed
    to deceptive marketing tactics anyway. If I fail because I adhere to this
    principle, then no, I'd rather just quit playing entrepreneurship rather
    than resort shitty marketing tactics.

    **This principle applies to art and entertainment as well, where the value
    can be the strong or positive emotions the consumer has felt.**

    Still, I'm sure there are lots of tools and products out there that solves
    real problem but hardly anyone knows about it. I guess what I'm saying is
    that marketing has it place, but it should be done out of necessity, not
    to the point that it overstates it's actual value just to increase sales.

    But marketing isn't just restricted to business premises, it also applies
    to presentation and individual branding. A person who is very presentable
    and have good branding has good marketability, regardless of the actual
    value that they can provide. Since I'm not really that useful as a person
    and I zero branding and presentability, it actually explains a lot why my
    life turned out like as such: a failure.

    Did I write all of that just to burn myself? Nah, I have high affinity
    with the fire element. After all, the weather forecast for the past few
    weeks has been consistently infernal heat and suffering, but it has yet to
    bother me (much).

    Except for yesterday though, that thunderstorm was freaking scary AF FR FR
    NC.

    Okay, going back on topic, I have three ideas. They are simple in a way
    that the value proposition is focused on one thing, and can be implemented
    in at most a week (assuming I get something each day). Basically, it
    applies the unix philisophy of being able to do one thing well, and is
    composable with other existing tools.

    As usual, there is the danger of changing my mind, and adding more
    features later on, resulting to overscoping and ultimately overspending my
    allocated time/effort budget. I am actively avoiding to jump right into
    code before I'm absolutely sure that the full product flow is complete,
    and I've covered all the cases on how to use it.

    The three product ideas I have are each supposed to solve one focused
    problem. Problems that I have, and hopefully others as well.

    The word "problem" here loosely refers to anything that is preventing me
    to achieve my goals, either through discomfort, inefficiency, reluctance
    or deficiency of resources. The word "solution" basically means
    eliminating or reducing the one or more problematic attributes above.

    This note has already gotten too long, so I will discuss with myself the
    first idea I have in mind.
