    Context: I took a break from hobby game development while I was trying to
    look for remote contract work. As I realized the futility of it, how I
    really don't care much about what most startups are doing and how current
    hiring processes are still broken (read: unfavorable for people like me),
    I decided to take a stab at the entrepreneurial route, where I have a much
    higher chance of success, for a very modest definition of success. There
    was an HN thread asking for books to help with entrepreneurship, and the
    book "Mom test" was one of the frequently recommended ones.

    So I started reading a book called "Mom Test" and have finished about 3/4
    of it. I think the book was way longer than necessary, and the core points
    could have been summarized in a chapter or two. To be fair, the core ideas
    can be indeed be found in the first few chapters, and the remaining
    chapters are just anecdotes that serve as proof, evidence or convincing
    explainations. I could have just stopped reading after the first few
    chapters, but I read on anyways, hoping I could gain some valuable
    insights from the author's personal experience.

    I did gain some insight, both from the author's story and from the lines
    in between. When reading, I almost always subconciously picture and trace
    what the author is thinking while writing something.

    Here's my impression, I could be wrong, but the author of the Mom's Test
    is definitely an extrovert. Not just an extrovert, but an extremely
    likeable, good-looking, highly agreeable extrovert.

    How did I come to that impression?

    For starters, there was a part in the book where the author made a beeline
    towards an unacquainted girl who was traveling to japan, if I recall that
    correctly, and then started asking about her life out of nowhere. How
    could someone do that and not get tazed or have the cops asking you
    questions? Such concept is so foreign to me that the story might have as
    well come from la-la land. These things only happen in fiction. That or
    the author is damn good-looking extrovert.

    The author also repeatedly expressed that people will lie to please you,
    will give out compliments when you want the cold hard bitter truth,
    resulting in not getting the essential information you wanted. This
    suspiciously sounds like the woes of someone for being too good-looking.
    His advice about people constantly lying to please and compliment you is
    very, very, *VERY* unrelatable. If I were in his situation, with the face
    of an goblin orc, what would people say when I start telling them my
    ideas? I would imagine most people telling me straight up front that it
    sucks, or at best, they would be unsure or apathetic about it. There would
    be cases that people do think it's great and would explicitly say that.
    But, here's my main objection, but does it really happen frequently that
    people give out compliments so much that it buries the truth of
    neutral/negative remarks and distorts the reality?

    No, I don't think so, unless the author purposely ignored the honest,
    negative remarks. That, or people can't but help but say nice things to
    him. Because the author is one handsome sonafakvetch,

    Well, it would be funny if I was wrong and the author actually looks like
    he descended from a lineage of pure-blooded orcs. I've ranted this much,
    and now I'm afraid to look up the author to invalidate my frustrations
    about this unfair world. A usual proxy for appearance is cash or power.
    Someone can have enough money to cover his face and people wouldn't
    realize he's an orc. So it's either the author looks like a hero that
    slays orcs, or looks like an orc but with tons of cash and power.

    Side note: I have nothing against people looking like orcs or goblins.
    I've personally known people who look like that, and they are one of the
    nicest people I've known. Notable one is a woman, can't tell what her age
    is, probably my age or older, and she works (or worked?) as a janitor in a
    university I went to. I bet she wouldn't be working as janitor if she had
    better looks. Unfortunate as it is, appearance plays a major role in life.
    It affects what kind of people gets attracted to you, and from that, it
    affects the kind of opportunities that come. Sure, uglier people have done
    well in life too, but there's no denying that good-looking people have
    better advantage.

    What's does the author being a good-looking extrovert have to do with
    anything? It means his *micro-advices* are very specific to his
    circumstances and to people like him. In other words, his prescribed
    actions and questions are not applicable to people on the opposite of the
    spectrum: introverted, argumentative, painful to look at, smelly AHAHA.
    Maybe the subtle implication is that entrepreneurship is only for the
    good-looking, likeable extroverts, but I digress.

    Around the three-quarters of the book, the author openly admitted that
    indirect communication, like email or phone calls, are not as effective as
    face-to-face interactions. From that, it's clear a lot of his
    micro-advices are for extroverts only. He could've stated that disclaimer
    right in the introduction. But no, the section "Is this book for you?" is
    devoid of any indication that you have to be a smooth talker to get most
    out of this book.

    At that point, I stopped reading soon after that part, feeling scammed and
    wanted a refund. No, I didn't even pay for the book, but I still felt
    scammed. That is how much I felt betrayed by the author, and those who
    recommended it without qualification. To be sure, it's a fine book, it's
    nice to read experience from a creature from a entirely different world.

    Still, his macro-advices, his general, more abstract points are still
    applicable: that I should make sure that the product I'm building has
    people that needs/wants it and at the same time willing to pay for it. To
    know what people want/need, I have to listen to them, and interact with
    them, not as a someone who has a product to shove down on their throat,
    but as a person who could solve their problems. Don't ask for their
    unmeasured opinions, ask for their actual, concrete experiences that is
    relevant to the would-be product. If the informal data shows an infeasible
    product, then drop the idea. Move on to other things. No use tending to
    your meadow if you ain't got any goats. What does that even mean? The heck
    do I know.

    Again, coming back to my earlier point, maybe the implication is that your
    have to be a smooth talking, good-looking extrovert to be a successful
    entrepreneur, and an entrepreneurship book for smelly, asocial, nitpicky
    nerds couldn't possibly exist.

    If this was the age before the internet became mainstream, then I would
    agree I have no business being an entrepreneur. But I could go a long way
    just with online interaction. Maybe not as effective as reaching out to
    people in person, but it's still doable. To begin with, I'm not aiming for
    a huge success. I'm just looking for ways to earn enough to pay the bills
    and don't have to work for anyone.

    In conclusion: the specifics of the book "The Mom Test" is not for me, but
    I still managed to get valuable lessons from it. I don't, or rather can't
    talk effectively to people in person. With great willpower I probably can,
    at the cost of my health. Also, I don't want to treat my potential
    customers like they're my mom. Heck, I'm quite sure my mom would be one of
    the first people to shoot my ideas down.

    If I were to make a crappy bootleg derivative version of the book, it
    would be called something like "I reincarnated as a smelly Orc but I'm too
    shy to eat the villagers." (title to change, or not)

    The core ideas would be: ]],

    UL {
        LI "Don't talk to people, they never tell the truth",
        LI "Approaching them will disturb the natural order",
        LI "Observe afar, behind the bushes, from the tree tops",
        LI {
            "Take detailed notes about their daily life:",
            UL {
                LI "eavesdrop on their conversations",
                LI "follow every footsteps they make",
                LI "hear them breath",
                LI "watch them sleep",
            },
        },
    },

    PP [[
      Observe attentively long enough, a pattern will eventually emerge. By the
      time the Orc ponders "Why do they keep doing this? They should just do
      this or use that.", the Orc has found a reason not to eat the villgers.
      That is to say, the Orc has a product to market.

      But the smelly Orc finds a dilemmna: he can't spell. No, that's not it.
      It's been 10 years, and his tummy is grumbling and he needs to act now.
      How can he trade the tasty plump chickens for the product he just built
      without approaching them villagers?

      Keep reading for the exciting development as the Orc overcomes the
      difficulties of not being able to face people!?!?!?..111

      Well, jokes aside, I should probably just find people to collaborate with,
      a co-founder or team to share ideas with. At least, that way, I would have
      accountability and there would be less chances of randomly quitting midway
      without a good reason. ]]
