    Following up from my last two notes about "Mom Test" and myrmarachne, here
    I will detail and outline my thoughts on how to become an entrepreneur. Or
    should I say, mimic what a real entrepreneur would do until I become
    indistinguishable from the real one.

    I'm not sure what entrepreneurship really means, or if I'm even spelling
    it correctly. But I can't be bothered looking it up because I have a
    roughly good idea what it means based on reading the Mom Test.

    In a nutshell, entrepreneurship involves legally earning money without
    someone ordering me what to do. It means finding a niche market segment,
    then building and selling a product for that niche. This is quite a
    general definition, but since I'm limited to things that can be done on a
    computer, it would only involves such as: ]],

    I guess writing a book could include manga if I can find an artist to
    collaborate with. I've been reading some mangas so I have some sense what
    a good manga is. Or not, manga seems like a risky product to build. I
    should stick to what I'm familiar with the most, and that is software
    development.

    First off, these are the goals and constraints: - product should be simple
    enough, ideally the minimum viable product is doable within a week or two
    - problem domain should not require specialized knowledge - earn around
    $500-$1000 with the product within the month or two - solves a real,
    actual problem - product maintenance should be low or non-existent, I
    don't want to end up in a situation where customers are screaming to get
    something fixed ASAP. The would be the worst case scenario, and I
    definitely would want to avoid products that include that kind of work. So
    basically, API services are a no-go, or any kind of SAAS/PAAS thingies.

    I really don't have a specific product in mind right now, so the first
    step would be data gathering, AKA mindlessly scroll the internet for clues
    and ideas. Hey, maybe I can even get inspiration from reading manga.
    What's that? You have an aberration that's bothering you for the entirety
    of your life? I've the right product for you Sir. That'll be 3 million
    yen, Sir. Why, yes, this is indeed cool a hawaiian shirt, thank you for
    noticing. That'll still be 3 million yen, Sir.

    More seriously, yeah, I do get inspirations and ideas from just mucking
    around. I should especially look out for people bitching about random
    stuffs on the internet, they are a valuable source of insight for
    potential product niche. Of course, I should keep in mind the lessons I
    learned from the Mom Test. Most important one being that I should make
    sure that people would show willingness to pay for a hypothetical
    solution.

    The second step would be reaching out to people, not to customers yet, but
    to potential collaborators to ask opinions from.

    That's the plan. I doubt I'd stick to it, but oh well. I'm just larping as
    an entrepreneur anyway. ]]
