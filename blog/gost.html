    I wrote my own static site generator many moons
    ago, and it's only now that I decided to use it.
    I can't remember exactly what the reason is for
    writing my own, but most likely reason is that I fell ill
    and showed severe signs of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH syndrome</a>
    for several days.
<p>
    In addition to NIH illness, I felt strongly that
    writing things from scratch is an instructive experience.
    I wouldn't know how to write a compiler just by using
    a compiler. Sadly, my compulsive tendency to write
    things from scratch quite often deviated me from pursuing
    my original goals.
<p>
    I wanted to start my own blog, so I wrote my own
    blog engine. Oh wait, I could generalize by writing
    a static site generator.
<p>
    My priority list apparently is poorly implemented
    and is riddled with bugs.
    It could've been worse though. At least I
    didn't start from writing my own http server or building
    my own universe.
<p>
    So about a hundred commits later, I had roughly working
    static site generator. Of course(?), by then
    I lost interest with this whole blogging activity.
    For some reason, the site generator felt tedious to use.
    I felt I didn't generalize enough abstractions.
    The templating syntax annoyed me and I wished for an
    embedded lisp interpreter instead.
<p>
    So, as usual, I lost interest, felt like I wasted
    my time, what have I been doing with my life, and so on.
    It was a period of downtime after that, I probably just played
    games all day long.
<p>
    Many, many depressing days later, here I am digging
    up an old, abandoned ruins for an artifact that I
    disposed. The code is not perfect, but it is still
    written sufficiently well that I am not attacked
    by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">
    sphagetti monster</a> when I need to add some features.
<p>
    The reason why I decided to use it now is because
    I need a static site generator. And I need a static
    site generator because I have some content that
    I <a href='justwrite.html'>wrote</a>
    at <a href='#404'>whim</a>,
    and several other projects that will
    sort of serve as my portfolio.
