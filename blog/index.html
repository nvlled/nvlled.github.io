<h3>On Blogging</h3>
<p>
    I don't think myself of a blogger,
    nor do I think I am qualified to be one.
    I don't even dream of maintaining one.
    Despite what I've just said, here I am
    and my written thoughts sadly contained in a
    blog.
<p>
    I don't know if it's just mozart's quartet no. 14
    playing in the background that's causing me
    to be at lost for words right now, or if it's just
    that I really have this natural difficulty of
    serializing my thoughts with ease and comfort.
<p>
    Well, I could increase verbosity of my text
    by including random, somewhat tangential texts,
    thus thereby deluding myself that what I have
    written represents (even in approximation) what
    I really have in my mind. It could work if
    I'm writing a fiction or I'm trying convince myself
    that I rendered productive work.
<p>
    I don't know. Maybe, I am being too pathological
    again when it comes to definitions. What is blogging?
    It's diary that is put on the web, like what girlies
    do when they are keen and young. Although
    theirs are kept hidden in dark,
    men with scruffy beard put their diaries on the web,
    because they are sad misunderstood creatures that
    grew tired of talking to rocks.
    I'm an amateur historian by the way, I just gave
    you the most inaccurate account of how blogging came to be.
<p>
    Blogging doesn't require precision of thought, I don't
    know where did I get that. Informally, a blog is just a written
    series of a person's daily life, for purposes of
    existential preservation, informative content and/or
    entertainment.
<p>
    But by writing in public, I am making myself vulnerable
    by creating an attack surface for people of different sorts
    to scritinize (scrutinize and criticize), such as my grammar,
    writing style, and reasoning. I will prepare my excuse in advance,
    and they will be readily available (in different formats, if desired)
    for anyone who felt naseaous while reading my writings.
<p>
    If I am being too defensive, it is only because
    I'm just applying a degree of caution--a programmer mindset
    where I try to consider and handle ugly corner cases.
    I think this <a href="https://pchiusano.github.io/2014-10-11/defensive-writing.html"> guy describes it more eloquently</a>.
<p>
    At one time, I felt too down to do anything.
    I couldn't play games, read books or program.
    It was then I decided to start
    <a href='justwrite.html'>Operation: Just Write</a>.
    I will be conforming to that principle while blogging.
<p>
    In shorter words, blogging is just writing for the heck
    of it. Hopefully, I'll do my part well as a heckofit-writer.
    As mozart's piece about to end, I should too (I mean this
    piece of writing of course).
<p>
    Oh yeah, I am using my own
    <a href='gost.html'>static site generator</a>.
    It's still lacking in features, but it works for me for
    the mean time.
