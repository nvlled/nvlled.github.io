I noticed it's difficult to get into the zone these days
when programming or learning new things,
so I'm going to do something different
for a change. It involves relaxing my stupid mind
a little, which means more fiction reading, watching anime
and playing games. In other words, waste my worthless
time some more until I off myself.

<p>
I tried that, and it doesn't work. Instead,
while I lag from productivity, I'm just going to
write just about anything. Of course, I, too,  already tried
doing nothing but writing before
(including eating, sleeping and breathing)
but it didn't work out because I quickly went
out of ideas and end up meta-writing about writing
and how pathetic my life is. I ended up being in the
writer's cubicle even I warmed up to writing.

<p>
The reasons are varied, one of which
is that I wanted to write something perfect
despite having no idea what perfect looks like.
Another reason is that my mind isn't in
working condition.

<p>
(note: doesn't follow from previous paragraph);
It's primarily because of a mindset that keeps
invading my thought process:
    feel guilt in expending
    time and effort in something that amounts or will amount
    to nothing and
    feel guilt for wasting my time not doing anything
    productive
<p>

It's a mindset that burns me out regardless of what I
do, be it programming, reading or even
doing nothing but playing games and watching anime
all day.
<p>

It's an invasive thought that takes quite
a mental effort to fight, which makes me want
to just sleep all day. So while I'm out of zone,
I'll just relax myself but still convince myself
that I'm not wasting my time. Writing
can be relaxing if done just for the heck of it,
and can be at the same time be considered
a productive work regardless of the content, shit or not.
So while playing games, watching anime, playing guitar et cetera,
I'll write something, anything.

<p>
So, I'll write in the same manner as I watch anime
or play games. I'll produce content like
I produce bodily fluids or exhale air.
I take a shit to relieve myself and not die of
toxication from the accumulated shit on my body.
It should be the same with writing without aim.
It's producing mental
excretions on a imaginary toilet.
I henceforth call it shwriting.

<p>
Shwriting is simple. There is no such thing a
incorrect grammar or dull style. Ignore
what other people will say, because
what else people will say about shit, except
it's shit. It's a truism that need not be uttered--
a defence mechanism without resorting to
being a masochist.
Hey, I know it's shit, I was just taking a crap so f??? you.
Incoherence, inconsistency, what's that?
Shits only serve the purpose of violating your olfactory senses.

<p>
You don't go around showing your crap to people,
unless they are some kind of crapologists that
gets paid to consume and appraise crap.
Actually people would gladly consume crap
if it was branded with excellence and exclusivity
or sugarcoated with likes and popularity, but
I have no intention of advertising my own crap.

<p>
The analogy between writing and excretion doesn't really stretch
far since unlike writing, there is very low possibility
that there will be a gold bar clogging my toilet
except on the rare cases I found a gold bar
and decided to temporarily store it in my intestines.
But it counters the purpose of shwriting
if I am actually expecting to shit a gold bar.

<p>
So don't expect a gold bar. Just take a crap,
but instead of flushing it, run it through
a purification process (if desired) that has value such
as fertilizers from manures or exotic
foods from ugly mammalian droppings ...

<p>
//todo: find a less disgusting analogy
