As usual, I'm chanting a magical barrier
called excuses/disclaimers before I cast
a spell called expressing myself. I have
to properly set up a fortified defense
because, after all, I'm weak and insecure.

Long time ago, before I didn't know any better,
I aspired of being a writer--a novelist in particular.
I sometimes received compliments of being good at english (writing).
Although being compared to people who
were barely fluent in english,
it's not saying much.

<p>
Still, my self-assessment says that I'm sort of good
when it comes to creative writing. Then I tried
creating a novel, and then failed really hard.
I obssessed too much in formulating a really original
plot, one that hasn't been conceived by anyone yet.
I gave up without even writing a single paragraph.

<p>
I guess I interpreted my self-directives literally.
I didn't have to be too original--just original enough
to keep myself from being filed charges relating
to intellectual property theft.

<p>
If I ever did succeed in creating an extremely original novel,
it would make use of no existing human knowledge,
not even english. It would be akin to reading a new math proof
where the words fuck you are written in precise greek dialect.

<p>
Now, after being exposed to programming and other formalisms,
I feel more mentally equipped when it comes to writing.
I'm not saying (yet) that I plan on shifting my goals
again and reconsider writing as my calling.

<p>
I'm just declaring writing as one of my hobby,
in addition to programming and
learning a bunch of other things.

<p>
I'll write out of interest, gratification or
<a href='../blog/justwrite.html'>frustration</a>,
and put them here to... to backup some of my files
in case my disk goes poof.
